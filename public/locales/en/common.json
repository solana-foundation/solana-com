Token extensions, on the other hand, are what the new token standard enables. Think of them as a list of new features and functions that can now function at the token program level.",
          "p2": "A few examples of what is possible natively with token extensions:",
          "l1": "Confidential transfers: The ability to mask token balances and the amounts of token transfers, with auditability from the issuer of the token",
          "l2": "Token gated transfers: The ability to control which wallets can receive tokens based on KYC identifiers",
          "l3": "Transfer Fees: The issuer of the token can charge transfer fees to assist in monetization of transactions",
          "l4": "Required metadata: Metadata about transfers can be mandatory, allowing payment attribution data to be bound to the transaction itself.",
          "p3": "There are several other extensions that enable additional rich functionality for digital asset issuers."
        }
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Are tokens minted using token extensions backwards compatible with dApps that support Solana tokens today?",
        "answer": "Tokens minted with token extensions belong to a new protocol. While the protocol is backwards compatible with the existing SPL Token standard, dApps must be upgraded to handle tokens minted with specific extensions."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Have token extensions been audited?",
        "answer": "Yes, the program has gone through 5 audits from the following security firms: Halborn, Zellic, NCC, Trail of Bits, and OtterSec."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Are there examples of stablecoins or digital assets that have been created using this new token standard?",
        "answer": "There are several projects about to launch RWA and stablecoins using this program. Paxos recently launched USDP on Solana leveraging token extensions, GMO Trust plans to launch a regulated stablecoin and several other major enterprises are planning on launching throughout the course of 2024."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "Can I use multiple extensions?",
        "answer": "Yes — however, some combinations are not yet ready to work in tandem. For example, transfer hooks and confidential transfers do not currently work together. For that particular case, a fix is being developed and can be tracked <0>here</0>."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "Are all of the extensions available today?",
        "answer": "With the exception of confidential transfers, all of the extensions are available for use today. Confidential transfers will be available once version 2.0 of the core Agave validator client is released and has been adopted by the network, which is expected to happen by EOY 2024."
      },
      "q9": {
        "question": "Can the program used for transfer hooks / permanent mint delegation be changed after mint initialization?",
        "answer": "Yes! As long as the requisite authority is reserved, the program used for both or either of those extensions can be updated to new PDAs."
      },
      "q10": {
        "question": "Can I create the destination ATA for a confidential transfer?",
        "answer": "While you can create the destination ATA for public transfers, the owner of that account needs to set up an encryption key, thus meaning that the owner must configure their account to accept confidential transfers before receiving confidential transfers."
      },
      "q11": {
        "question": "Can multiple auditors be set for the confidential transfer authority?",
        "answer": "No. Only a single ElGamal public key (derivable from an ed25519 private key) can be set, and without a fancy key-sharing implementation that single key is the only one capable of auditing transfer amounts."
