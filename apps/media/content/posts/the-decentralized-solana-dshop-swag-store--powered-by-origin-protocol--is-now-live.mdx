For the past several weeks, the Solana Foundation has fielded dozens of requests for the ability to purchase gear with Solana branding. The call has been answered, and you can now purchase a variety of clothing, stickers, and household goods with unique Solana branding! This Solana Swag Store is powered by [Origin Protocol](https://www.originprotocol.com/en) and uses its new, decentralized e-commerce platform, [DShop](https://www.originprotocol.com/en/product). You can check out the [Solana Swag Store here now.](https://store.solana.com/#/)

The Solana community includes tens of thousands of developers, traders, enthusiasts, validators, and holders all over the world. There are several ways to become more involved with Solana: you can contribute to the project as a [Validator](https://solana.com/validators), apply for the [Solana Collective](https://solana.com/collective) or [Solana Accelerator](https://solana.com/accelerator) program, attend an event either online or in your local community, join one of the many community groups in Telegram, and much more. These are just a few of the ways to get involved, our community is constantly brainstorming new and exciting ways to get more people involved. Opening the decentralized swag store with branded Solana swag allows any individual regardless of geographic location, background, or occupation to become part of the powerful global community, sharing pride for technological innovations and decentralization. With the purchase of any item from the minimalist but outstanding Solana Series, you become the ultimate supporter of our mission of being the greatest option for all high-growth and high-frequency blockchain applications and to democratize the world’s financial systems.

In turn, the Solana Foundation will continue to put effort toward making the world a place for equality and justice for all regardless of race or gender. In order to follow up on our words beyond a social media post, the Solana Foundation will be donating all proceeds from the store for the remainder of June, in addition to the $11,000 already donated internally from employees. For the rest of June, all proceeds from the Solana Swag shop will be donated to parties trying to organize and advocate for racial, social, and economic justice. You can find the list of supported organizations on the [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/partners/) website.
