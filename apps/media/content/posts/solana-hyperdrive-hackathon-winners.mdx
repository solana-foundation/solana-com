The Solana Foundation is thrilled to announce the results of the [Solana Hyperdrive Hackathon](https://solana.com/hyperdrive), an online competition focused on bringing the next wave of high-impact projects into the Solana ecosystem. Hyperdrive was the eighth Solana hackathon, bringing together founders and developers from around the world to launch products spanning Infrastructure, Mobile Consumer Apps, Payments, DAOs, AI, and everything in-between.

Hyperdrive saw more than 7,000 participants submit 907 final projects to the judges, the largest online Solana hackathon to date and the latest in a stream of growing submissions. AWS, Ironforge, UXD, Magic Eden, IO.NET, Helio, Phantom, The Network State, and EasyA joined the Solana Foundation as category sponsors for the hackathon, offering a platform for crypto startups to jumpstart their journey.

“Solana Hackathons are where new startups are made, and Hyperdrive was no exception,” said Dan Albert, executive director of the Solana Foundation. “The nearly 1,000 teams built during Hyperdrive are going to be among the ones shaping the future of entertainment, infrastructure, finance, mobile, and more.”
