The bear is here. It’s time to fight back.

The Solana Foundation is excited to announce Grizzlython, an online, global Solana hackathon with $5 million in prizes and seed funding. Grizzlython, the seventh Solana hackathon, will run Feb. 2 - March 14, and is open to builders around the globe.

Solana hackathons are competitions that enable members of the Solana community to bring their ideas to life and then to market. This sprint helps builders kickstart their projects and turn them into growing, fundable companies. The previous Solana Hackathon, [Solana Summer Camp](https://solana.com/summercamp?ref=solana.ghost.io), saw nearly 18,000 participants submit 750 projects. Cumulatively, Solana hackathon projects have raised over $600m in venture funding.

Builders will be able to participate in a full slate of Grizzlython programming, including office hours with the Solana Foundation Developer Relations Team, Solana Hacker Houses in [Istanbul](https://solana.com/events/istanbulhh?ref=solana.ghost.io) and [Melbourne](https://solana.com/events/melbournehh?ref=solana.ghost.io), Twitter spaces, Twitch streams, and more. Participants will also be able to meet IRL at community-run coworking spaces in [Singapore](https://lu.ma/SolanaXMetacamp?ref=solana.ghost.io), [Berlin](https://lu.ma/build-station-berlin?ref=solana.ghost.io), [Salt Lake City](https://qkcnv8w3wdg.typeform.com/to/mzeNTFkk?ref=solana.ghost.io), [Ho Chi Minh City](https://vn.superteam.fun/build-station?ref=solana.ghost.io), [Bangalore](https://superteam.fun/solana-buildstation-india?ref=solana.ghost.io), [Delhi](https://superteam.fun/solana-buildstation-india?ref=solana.ghost.io), and [Melbourne](https://www.driftmesummercamp.com/?ref=solana.ghost.io).

In addition to a competition-wide Grand Champion, Grizzlython will have prizes across seven different tracks that epitomize the growing Solana ecosystem — Mobile, DeFi, Payments, Web3 Consumer, Tools + Infrastructure, Gaming, and DAOs + Network States.

Projects will be eligible for:

- **The Grand Champion** will receive $50,000 USDC, three passes to [Breakpoint 2023](https://solana.com/breakpoint?ref=solana.ghost.io), and the chance to present their projects to the greater Solana community.
- Five prizes each in the **Mobile, DeFi, Payments, Web3 Consumer, Tools + Infrastructure, Gaming, and DAOs + Network States tracks**, ranging from $30,000 USDC to $10,000 USDC.
- **The University Award,** a $20,000 USDC prize presented to the best student team
- **The Climate Award,** promoting green and climate-friendly projects, will receive $5,000 USDC.
- All prize winners will have the opportunity to present their project to potential investors at **an exclusive Demo Day.**
