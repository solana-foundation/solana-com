## **Bringing Crypto Into the Real World**

“Crypto has been ‘magical internet money’ for so long, it’s easy to forget how transformative it is,” said Josh Fried, Head of Loyalty at the Solana Foundation. “With Onchain Holiday, users will be able to spend money that has been sitting in their crypto wallets to purchase gifts for loved ones. On the flip side, retailers will experience the ease of accepting Solana-based payments and participate in the future of ecommerce.”

The Solana ecosystem has long been a home for real-world applications of decentralized technology, such as [decentralized infrastructure networks](https://solana.com/news/case-study-helium) or [fan loyalty programs](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/eric-church-nashville-bar-chiefs-1234980079/). Onchain Holiday again shows just how close those connections between internet markets and the real world truly are.

The Solana network’s near-instant settlement and low fees are turbocharged by innovative, user-friendly primitives that simplify the process for taking action on the Solana network.

Onchain Holiday is made possible by [blinks and Solana Actions](https://solana.com/solutions/actions), unique innovations made possible by teams in the Solana ecosystem. Solana Actions and blinks, developed by an ecosystem-wide team led by [Dialect](https://www.dialect.to/actions). Using the APIs originally built to support Solana Pay, developers can connect hyperlinks, QR codes, push notifications, and more to allow any user to make a transaction on the Solana blockchain without having to go into their wallet. And with Helio’s [Solana Pay x Shopify](https://www.hel.io/shopify-stores) plugin, retailers participating in Onchain Holiday can simply connect to their existing Shopify storefront and accept crypto payments. (Want to learn how to implement these primitives for your business? See the developer docs for [Actions](https://docs.dialect.to/documentation/actions), [blinks](https://docs.dialect.to/documentation/actions/blinks), and [Solana Pay x Shopify](https://docs.hel.io/product-guides/solana-pay-shopify-plugin).)

Get ready to experience some holiday internet magic this December! Onchain Holiday begins 5 December 2024.
