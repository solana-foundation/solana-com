At approximately 16:30 UTC on Wednesday, June 1, Solana’s Mainnet Beta cluster ceased producing blocks as result of stalled consensus, caused by a bug in the durable nonce transactions feature. Over the next four and a half hours, validator operators worked to identify the point of furthest progress and collectively instituted a restart of the network, which resulted in durable nonce transactions being temporarily disabled. Block production resumed at 21:00 UTC the same day, and network operators continued to restore client services over the next several hours.

Note: This issue was unrelated to improvements in 1.10 and 1.11. You can read more about these forthcoming improvements [here](https://solana.com/news/04-30-22-solana-mainnet-beta-outage-report-mitigation?ref=solana.ghost.io).

## **What caused the outage?**

A runtime bug triggered by the durable nonce transactions feature allowed, under a specific set of circumstances, for a failed durable nonce transaction to be processed twice. This led to nondeterminism, when a validator processed the transaction a second time and some nodes rejected the subsequent block, while others accepted it. Critically, more than 33% of validators accepted the block, but that number fell short of the 66% required to reconcile the nondeterminism.

## **How are nonce transactions supposed to work, and how are they different from normal transactions?**

Solana utilizes parallel processing of non-overlapping transactions to greatly improve throughput. Networks that process transactions serially can use an incrementing nonce; Solana uses a different method to ensure transactions are not processed twice. For normal transactions, which make up over 99.99% of transactions on the Solana blockchain, the network utilizes a recent block hash and maintains a record of processed transactions within that window to ensure that duplicates are not processed.

Because [durable nonce transactions](https://docs.solana.com/offline-signing/durable-nonce?ref=solana.ghost.io#:~:text=Durable%20transaction%20nonces%20are%20a,read%20about%20in%20the%20proposal.) are designed to not expire, they require a different mechanism to prevent double processing, and are processed serially. Such transactions use an on-chain value specific to each account that is rotated every time a durable nonce transaction is processed. After the value is rotated, the same durable nonce transaction should not be able to be processed again.

## **What happened?**

The processing of a durable nonce transaction in a specific set of circumstances revealed a bug in the runtime that prevented the network from advancing. This bug required the durable nonce transaction to have failed, and would not have been triggered by a successful transaction.

- The durable nonce transaction was processed while its blockhash was still recent enough for the transaction to be processed as a normal transaction
- Seeing a recent blockhash, the runtime assumed it was processing a normal transaction, not a durable nonce transaction
- This transaction failed and since it was not processed as a durable transaction, processing did not advance the on-chain nonce value as intended
- Because the failed transaction was successfully added to a block, its transaction fees were paid
- After the durable transaction was processed once and failed, it was still able to be processed again as a durable transaction because the nonce value it referenced had not been advanced and was still usable.
-

After the failed transaction was processed, but before the nonce was used again, the user resubmitted the same transaction for processing. This resubmission activated the bug in the runtime. 

- The failed durable nonce transaction was re-submitted to the cluster
- The block producer incorrectly accepted this transaction into the block it was building, because the nonce value on-chain had not been advanced
- When validators validated the block, a portion found the new block included a transaction that had previously been processed, caused by the inclusion of this durable nonce transaction.
- One set of validators rejected the block, while another set accepted the block, because the previous instance of the transaction was no longer in their recently processed cache.
- Critically, more than 33% of validators accepted the block, but that number fell short of the 66% required to reconcile the nondeterminism.
-

## **What is being done?**

The durable nonce transaction feature was disabled in releases v1.9.28/v1.10.23 to prevent the network from halting if the same situation were to arise again. Durable nonce transactions will not process until [the mitigation](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/25744?ref=solana.ghost.io) has been applied, and the feature re-activated in a forthcoming release.
