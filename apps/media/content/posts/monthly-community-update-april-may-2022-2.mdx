## **Transaction Requests: Bringing smart purchases to Solana Pay**

It was a packed house at San Francisco’s Atlas Cafe on May 5th, 2022. The Solana Pay team had taken the iconic coffeehouse to show the world its latest innovation — transaction requests.

“What transaction requests do is allow any NFT to act as a loyalty token,” said Sheraz Shere, head of payments for Solana Labs, in a video from the event. People at the event received a special NFT, which automatically generated a 20% discount when using Solana Pay. “NFT loyalty, in a box,” he said.

When it was introduced in February 2022, the Solana Pay protocol acted as a one-way payments rail that allowed people to easily transfer tokens using a QR code, making it easy to connect wallets for IRL purchases.

“But with transaction requests,” writes Solana Labs engineer Jordan Sexton, “it’s now possible to bring any Solana transaction into the real world through an interactive request between a checkout app and a mobile wallet, enabling NFT minting, dynamic discounts, tokenized loyalty programs, and so much more.”

That means that purchases can become much more than a single, one way transaction — they can become conversations. Taking the dynamic experience of Solana transactions IRL means that consumers and merchants can both benefit more meaningfully from a commerce transaction. At Atlas Cafe, more than 400 attendees received the NFT loyalty token establishing a lasting, direct connection between the cafe and its customers, many of whom had never used a crypto wallet before attending. That’s something to celebrate!
