## **☀️ Happy Solstice! Look back at the year in Solana**

The winter solstice is on December 20th — and what better time to look back at Solana's stellar year?

Back in January 2021, when Solana was less than a year old, it had **10 billion total transactions, $100 million total value locked, 360 global validators, and 70 total projects.**

By December, those numbers had taken off: **45.5 billion transactions, $11.4 billion TVL, 1,328 global validators, and 5,145 total projects in the ecosystem, plus more than 1 million NFTs minted, 5,985 total public repos, and many more highlights.**

Remember how far the community has come — and get hyped — [at the Solana blog.](https://solana.com/news/happy-solstice-2021-celebrating-solanas-sunny-year)

## **🌱 The Solana network is now fully carbon neutral**

Big news, fam! **The Solana Foundation announced that it has offset the Solana network's low carbon impact.** To complement [Solana's low energy impact](https://solana.com/environment), the Foundation is funding refrigerant destruction, which Green America lists as [one of the highest-impact ways to reduce carbon emissions.](https://www.greenamerica.org/climate-change-100-reasons-hope/top-10-solutions-reverse-climate-change)

The Solana Foundation will continue to monitor Solana's impact on the environment, and pledges to keep the network carbon neutral in the years to come. [Learn more here.](https://solana.com/news/solana-foundation-carbon-neutral-2021)

## **🏀 Michael Jordan launches project on Solana**

Come on and slam, and welcome to the jam. Michael Jordan and his son Jeffrey M. Jordan have announced that they are launching HEIR, a platform for empowering athletes, on Solana.

HEIR intends to connect athletes with their biggest fans using their own social token, as well as NFTs. [Learn more about it at Decrypt.](https://decrypt.co/88393/michael-jordan-jumps-into-web3-solana-app-athletes-nfts-tokens)

## **🦑 And the Squid Prize winner is....**

The Squid Prize is a biannual celebration of people who have made extraordinary contributions to the Solana community. This month, the Solana community spoke up and recognized the contributions of [@sainteclectic](https://twitter.com/sainteclectic).

Squid Prize winners are the people who, in their free time, make a positive impact with both new and veteran community members. With [their educational threads](https://twitter.com/sainteclectic/status/1460995261338046466) and involvement across the ecosystem, @sainteclectic has done that and much more.

[Go on over to Twitter](https://twitter.com/solana/status/1478481566515007495) and wish them congratulations!
