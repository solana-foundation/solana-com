## **A worldwide hackathon with up to $1 million in prizes and seed funding**

The Solana Foundation is excited to announce Solana Season, a global hackathon focused on Web3, DeFi, and NFTs. Solana Season will take place over the course of three weeks starting on May 15th!

Our [winter hackathon](https://solana.com/news/winners-of-the-solana-x-serum-defi-hackathon/?ref=solana.ghost.io) saw over 3,000 registrations and 100+ final projects submitted, so this time we’re expanding our reach across use case verticals, with additional regional tracks in China, India, Eastern Europe, and Brazil. Each track will have its own set of supporting projects and panel of judges, as well as offline workshops and events.

**Need some inspiration on what to build?** [**Check out the list of project ideas to explore**](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-season/blob/master/ideas.md?ref=solana.ghost.io)

The hackathon features up to $1 million in prizes and seed funding. A Grand Prize of $30k will be awarded to the team with the best project submission. . There are 3 category tracks: DeFi, Web3, and NFTs, each with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners who will receive $20k, $10k, and $5k prizes in USDC-SPL, respectively. For more info on prizes, developer guides, and other helpful resources, visit the [official hackathon Github](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-season?ref=solana.ghost.io).

There will be additional prizes for regional tracks including:

- Eastern Europe track which will have a $155k prize pool with contributions from Hacken, Gate.io, Serum, Velas, HAPI, and Akash Network.
- China track with $125k in prizes coming from Solana Foundation, Serum, and Raydium.
- India track which will have a $50k total prize pool and contributions from the Solana Foundation, Devfolio, and CoinDCX.
- Brazil will see a $25k prize pool with support from BRZ Brazil, Foxbit, Bitpreço, NOX Bitcoin, and Alterbank.

Individual projects will also have the chance to compete for added prizes with support from Serum, Kin, Raydium, and Pyth. Judges and speakers will include Balaji Srinivasan, Kevin Rose, Sam Bankman Fried, RAC, Robert Leshner, Anatoly Yakovenko, Meltem Demirors, Jason Choi, Tegan Kline, Kyle Samani, Ali Yayha, Travis Kling, Santiago Santos, Ledger Status, Tarun Chitra, Jeremy Allaire, Imran Khan, James Prestwich, David Nage, Arthur Cheong, Crypto Messiah, Dan Gunsberg, and David Ratney.

The Solana Season Hackathon is a competition where projects will be evaluated by judges on their technological merits without consideration of legal viability and will be open to any use case that involves Solana. Participants in the hackathon will create software solely for purposes of evaluation by judges as part of a competition and not for commercial deployment or release as part of the Hackathon. Following its completion, any hackathon projects that are interested in building on Solana full-time will have the opportunity to connect with leading venture capitalists, ecosystem funds, and angel investors for seed funding to accelerate the growth of their project.

**Disclaimers**

The Solana Season Hackathon (the “Hackathon”) is a competition where projects will be evaluated by judges on their technological merits without consideration of legal viability. Participants in the Hackathon will create software solely for purposes of evaluation by judges as part of a competition and not for commercial deployment or release as part of the Hackathon.All participants must comply with applicable laws and regulations when releasing any software that they develop as part of the Hackathon.

The Hackathon ideas and developer resources that Solana Foundation (“SF”) provides are for educational and inspirational purposes only. SF does not encourage, induce or sanction the deployment of any such applications in violation of applicable laws or regulations. SF does not encourage, induce or sanction the deployment, integration or use of any such applications (including the code comprising the Solana blockchain protocol) in violation of applicable laws or regulations and hereby prohibits any such deployment, integration or use. This includes use of any such applications by the reader (a) in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction, (b) if the reader is located in or ordinarily resident in a country or territory subject to comprehensive sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), (c) if the reader is or is working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions, or (d) in violation of the Commodities and Exchange Act.

The reader should be aware that U.S. export control and sanctions laws prohibit U.S. persons (and other persons that are subject to such laws) from transacting with persons in certain countries and territories or that are on the SDN list. As a project based primarily on open-source software, it is possible that such sanctioned persons may nevertheless bypass prohibitions, obtain the code comprising the Solana blockchain protocol (or other project code or applications) and deploy, integrate, or otherwise use it. Accordingly, there is a risk to individuals that other persons using the Solana blockchain protocol may be sanctioned persons and that transactions with such persons would be a violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions law. This risk applies to individuals, organizations, and other ecosystem participants that deploy, integrate, or use the Solana blockchain protocol code directly (e.g., as a node operator), and individuals that transact on the Solana blockchain through light clients, third party interfaces, and/or wallet software.
