Get your calendars ready. Breakpoint 2023, the annual gathering of the Solana community being held Oct. 30-Nov. 3 in Amsterdam, is only a few short weeks away! [Purchase your tickets now.](https://solana.com/breakpoint/tickets)

This year’s Breakpoint promises to be the most interesting and insightful one yet, with keynote talks, workshops, panel discussions, and fireside chats from some of the brightest minds in and out of the Solana ecosystem.

Some of the planned programming includes:

- Keynotes from industry leaders from Google Cloud, Circle, Star Atlas, and other luminaries working in the Solana ecosystem.
- Developer workshops, covering everything from the basics of building on Solana to how to build with exciting innovations like state compression or xNFTs.
- Thought-provoking panels at the forefront of blockchain, such as “How AI Can Accelerate the Adoption of DeFi,” “Regulatory Compliance in Web3,” and “How to Build Private Solana Programs.”
- The Neodyme Security Stage — a full day of programming dedicated to building more secure, robust systems.
- Experiential activations and immersive experiences by artists and teams in the Solana ecosystem.
- A Community Basecamp with lounges, activations, and events from teams across the Solana ecosystem offering attendees the chance to connect with their favorite communities.
- Free access for Breakpoint ticket holders for on-campus events, like [the Network State Conference](https://lu.ma/tnsconf), [MEV Camp](https://lu.ma/tsh05i9i), [the Block Zero Solana Validator Summit](https://lu.ma/0k9m99s1), and [DRiP Haus](https://lu.ma/drip) (see more [here](https://solana.com/breakpoint/side-events)).
- The awards ceremony for the winners of the [Solana Hyperdrive Hackathon](https://solana.com/hyperdrive).
- A slate of intriguing announcements and news.
