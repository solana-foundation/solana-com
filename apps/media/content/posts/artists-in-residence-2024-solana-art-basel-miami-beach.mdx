The Solana community returns to Art Basel Miami Beach for a second installment of the hit exhibition _Artists in Residence,_ which this year is exploring the theme of Digital Transformation: From Nature to Machine. As digital technologies like blockchain become increasingly intertwined in daily lives, nature remains a constant presence. This year's exhibition invites the attendees to examine the relationship between nature and machines from the viewpoint of artists in the Solana community.

_Artists in Residence_ is a living studio where attendees can experience artists’ creative processes in real time, interact directly, and learn how using Solana has benefitted their work. This year’s _Artists in Residence_ include:

---

**Leo Caillard:** A contemporary artist internationally recognized for the quality of his marble sculptures as well as for his digital creations at the cutting edge of new technologies. Leo Caillard opens a dialogue between eras through the use of these two mediums and the unique aesthetic of his art, mixing figures from ancient statuary and abstract digital forms.

_”The tech in the Solana ecosystem pushes the limits of digital art, allowing me to integrate my classical art background with modern practices. The Solana community focuses on creating meaningful connections between physical and digital art, making it a perfect environment for innovation and exploration.”_

**Laura El:** A New York City-based artist known for her intricate line work and narrative-driven illustrations. Her vibrant yet detailed pieces often portray cityscapes and capture everyday moments of the people who live there, creating a sense of connection. Her work carries a touch of nostalgia, blending the real and the fantastical in a way that feels both fresh and intimately familiar.

_“Building on Solana has been life-changing for me as an artist. It has allowed me to create and share the art I love, rather than working on commissions for others. The supportive and welcoming community made it possible for my work to be seen and appreciated, transforming my experience and helping me stand out in an often saturated market."_

**Lance Weiler (Culture Hacker):** A storyteller and media artist, working across film, theatre, games, and code. An alumnus of the Sundance Screenwriters Lab, Lance is recognized as a pioneer for his innovative blending of storytelling, art, and technology. He has presented work at MoMA, the New Museum, PAM, ArtYard, TIFF Lightbox, as well as the Sundance, Tribeca, Cannes, and New York Film Festivals. He is a Professor of Professional Practice at Columbia University, where he also founded the school’s Digital Storytelling Lab.

_“The Solana ecosystem has created a space where digital art can thrive natively onchain. There is a vibrant arts community and an opportunity to leverage innovative tools. Art has the power to connect people in meaningful ways and it's an important complement in an ecosystem with strong builders."_

Art will also be on display throughout the exhibition from a number of artists in the Solana community who embody the theme of digital transformation through their work, including **Ira Greenberg, Degen Poet, Tiiiny Denise, Duke +1, Alkan Avcıoğlu, Jake Andrew, LowBrow and Joice Loo.**

The selected artists use modern tools not just to create art but to explore the interactions between digital systems and the natural world. This merging of disciplines challenges the traditional notions of "nature" versus "machine," suggesting that technological creations are extensions of the organic world rather than adversaries. The exhibition will allow attendees to reflect on the ways in which nature and machines coexist and inspire one another.

This year’s _Artists in Residence_ showcase is supported by The Render Network, a decentralized GPU rendering platform built on Solana. The Render Network provides a near-endless supply of GPUs to render complex art, enabling artists to push the limits of what can be done in Octane, Unreal Engine, Blender, Houdini and other leading 3D programs. During Art Basel Miami Beach, the Render Network is committing over $100k to grants to artists that use the Render Network. They also are announcing an AI Fellowship Program, which aims to put together technical hackers and artists to create immersive art experiences – [follow along](https://x.com/rendernetwork) for those updates.
