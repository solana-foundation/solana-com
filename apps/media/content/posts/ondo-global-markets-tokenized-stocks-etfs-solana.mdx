**Today, [Ondo Global Markets](https://ondo.finance/blog/global-markets-live-on-solana) expands to Solana, offering 200+ tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs onchain.** 

Ondo Global Markets, the world’s largest tokenized stock and ETF platform by total value locked (TVL), is now available on Solana. Users can access more than 200 tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs, including stocks like NVDA, AAPL, META, and CRCL; and ETFs like SPY and QQQ.

With this launch, Ondo Global Markets becomes the largest real-world asset issuer on Solana by asset count, representing approximately [65% of all tokenized real-world assets currently live on the Solana network.](https://app.rwa.xyz/networks/solana)

### Highlights

* **Widest variety of assets –** More than 200 tokenized U.S. stocks & ETFs available on Solana, including stocks, ETFs, funds, and commodities.   
* **Deepest liquidity onchain –** Ondo Global Market assets offer liquidity and slippage comparable to traditional exchanges.  
* **Fully backed 1:1 –** Each token is fully backed by the corresponding stock or ETF, held with one or more licensed U.S. custodial broker-dealers.  
* **Mint & redeem model –** Tokens can be minted and redeemed 24 hours a day, five days a week, with the flexibility to use and transfer onchain anytime. 

This launch enables non-U.S. users around the world to invest in tokenized versions of U.S. stocks, while maintaining the institutional-grade backing and tapping into the deep liquidity of traditional exchanges via Ondo. 

### How does Ondo Global Markets on Solana work?

Ondo tokenized stocks and ETFs are total-return trackers that mirror the economic performance of their underlying assets, including price movements, dividends, and corporate actions. Dividends are automatically reinvested net of applicable tax withholdings. 

For example, AAPLon reflects the total return of Apple Inc. (AAPL). When Apple issues a dividend, the value is reinvested and reflected on Solana as an increase in the number of AAPLon tokens held, while prices remain quoted in USD. 

These tokens are backed 1:1 by securities held at US-registered broker-dealers. They can be minted and redeemed 24 hours a day, five days a week, with the flexibility to move between wallets and DeFi protocols anytime. 

At launch, Ondo Global Markets assets on Solana are available via Jupiter. Over time, Ondo’s tokenized stocks will be available across Solana wallets, exchanges, and DeFi protocols, expanding what’s possible across trading, portfolio construction, and onchain finance.
