## Markdown, But Better

Hello, the current date is <DateTime format="local" />. Markdown is great for writing content, but what if you need something more interactive? What if you want to pull in dynamic data, display formatted callouts, or collect user input? That's where components come in.

---

```graphql
query MyQuery($relativePath: String!) {
  page(relativePath: $relativePath) {
    title
  }
}
```

> With components, your Markdown content isn't just static text—it becomes a dynamic experience. You can fetch data, format content beautifully, and even build interactive elements directly inside your posts.

## Why Use Components in Markdown?

- **Keep Content Dynamic** - Pull in real-time data instead of static text.
- **Improve Readability** - Use structured callouts, buttons, and forms.
- **Enhance User Interaction** - Let users take action directly in the content.

<gallery
  background="bg-default"
  images={[
    {
      heading: "Test",
      body: "A body",
      button: { link: "#", label: "Its a good", type: "default" },
      size: "large",
      image: { src: "/uploads/posts/default-blog.webp" },
      square: true,
    },
    {
      image: { src: "/uploads/posts/default-blog.webp" },
      size: "small",
      square: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

## More Ways to Use Components

1. **Embed GraphQL Queries** - Fetch and display content dynamically.
2. **Use Styled Callouts** - Highlight key points with visually distinct elements.
3. **Create Interactive Forms** - Let users sign up, submit data, or engage with your content.

  Back in '82, I could code Markdown blindfolded. If I had these components back then, I'd be
  running the biggest blog on the internet, no doubt.
