## **Grape: Bringing DAO people together**

The DAOs were building in Athens, the cradle of democracy.

In May, [Grape](https://grapes.network/?ref=solana.ghost.io) held [AthensDAO](https://athensdao.net/?ref=solana.ghost.io), the first community-driven Hacker House X with support from the Solana Foundation. The event brought together a who’s who of the people, groups, and communities all building new tools and use cases for DAOs on Solana.

“One of the magical things about this hacker house… \[is\] you had a niche focus and the right people to fit that niche,” said Dean Pappas, a core contributor to Grape. That led to an explosion of creativity and, as he put it, “really cool projects.”

“I try to spend my time on what I’m very passionate about,” Pappas said, “and it’s mostly digital governance.”

It makes sense that Grape would host a house for DAOs – it’s in their DNA. Grape is a tokenized community that acts as a one-stop shop for building a community on Solana. Pappas said Solana is ideal for DAOs because “to experiment in governance and think about all these new ideas, these wacky things, you need very cheap transactions, they need to happen fast, and you need a very good user experience.”

The Grape DAO is split into several subDAO councils — such as NFTs, gaming, evaluating bounties, and more — that focus on communities in specific areas. All the councils use [Realms](https://realms.today/realms?ref=solana.ghost.io) or [Squads](https://squads.so/?ref=solana.ghost.io), common Solana governance tools. “It is the best expression of what a decentralized community looks like,” Pappas said.

After attending [mtnDAO](https://twitter.com/mtnDAO?ref=solana.ghost.io) — a long-form, community-driven incubator and hacker house held in Salt Lake City last winter — the Grape team was inspired to host one of their own with a specific focus on governance, closer to where many of the Solana DAO builders were located in Europe. And when the Hacker House X grant program was unveiled, they applied and received support from the Solana Foundation.

And once the house got started, the 150 builders really went wild. In addition to new projects from [Civic](https://twitter.com/civickey?ref=solana.ghost.io), [Gilder](https://twitter.com/gilderxyz?ref=solana.ghost.io), and others, the members of AthensDAO formed their own DAO. “The idea behind the AthensDAO DAO is to make sure that we can perpetually do this,” Pappas said. “What's really cool about the formation of that DAO is the only people who are part of that DAO were physically there.”

What’s next? Pappas is focused on building the structure for AthensDAO DAO so they can host a future event. [But the next Hacker House X is in your hands.](https://solanalabs.typeform.com/hackerhouseX?ref=solana.ghost.io)
