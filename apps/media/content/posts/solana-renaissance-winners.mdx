Colosseum is thrilled to announce the results of the Solana Renaissance Hackathon, a global online competition focused on bringing the next wave of high-impact projects into the Solana ecosystem. Renaissance was the 9th Solana Foundation hackathon, bringing together founders and developers from 95+ countries to build products spanning Infrastructure, Gaming, DePIN, DAOs, DeFi, and a long-tail of Consumer Applications.

[More than 8,300 participants from 95 countries teamed up to submit 1,071 final projects](https://arena.colosseum.org/projects/explore) to the judges, making Renaissance the largest online Solana hackathon to date. Symmetry, Phantom, IO.NET, Pyth, Orca, Solana Mobile, Squads, and Brave joined the Solana Foundation as sponsors for the hackathon, offering a platform for crypto founders to jumpstart their journey.

“Solana Hackathons are the epicenter of startup formation in the ecosystem, and Renaissance was no exception," said Dan Albert, Executive Director of the Solana Foundation. "A new wave of highly talented developers and founders are now building promising products that will continue to take crypto into mainstream adoption."

Without further ado, here are the winners…
