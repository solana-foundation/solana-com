If you are a young builder and want to get a headstart in the Solana ecosystem, there’s some exciting news for you!

Solana Labs, in partnership with Jump Crypto, is proud to announce the Breakpoint Global Fellows Program. This special scholarship opportunity, funded by select ecosystem partners and donations from community members, will award young engineers between the ages of 16 and 24 a significant stipend to attend the Solana Breakpoint conference in Lisbon, Portugal this November.

Fellows will become part of a global community of builders and get a number of unique opportunities: Research projects, one-on-one connections with the Solana Labs and Solana ecosystem teams, follow-up events and programming, plus internship and employment opportunities.

The Global Fellows Program welcomes applicants from around the world. Solana Labs is committed to investing in the youngest bright minds in the Solana community, no matter where they are based.

**Applications are due at 11:59pm PT on October 1st, 2021.** Applicants will be notified by mid-October, and Solana Breakpoint is November 7th-10th. Solana Labs will be looking for potential fellows who are most likely to make the most of the program’s resources and the biggest impact on the ecosystem. To apply, **you must be between the ages of 16 and 24** and fill out the form below.
