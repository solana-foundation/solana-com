The Solana Foundation is thrilled to announce the results of the [Solana Grizzlython Online Hackathon](https://solana.com/grizzlython?ref=solana.ghost.io), a global competition focused on bringing the next wave of high-impact projects into the Solana ecosystem. Grizzlython is the seventh Solana hackathon, bringing together founders and developers from around the world to launch products spanning Infrastructure, Payments, DeFi, Mobile, Gaming, DAOs and Network States, Web3 Consumer and everything in-between.

Grizzlython saw over 10,000 participants submit 813 final projects to the judges, the largest Solana hackathon to date. Stripe, Amazon Web Services, Monaco Protocol, SolanaFM, Brave, Solana Mobile, Superteam, EasyA, and Hello Moon joined the Solana Foundation as category sponsors for the hackathon, offering a platform for Solana ecosystem teams to jumpstart their crypto journey.

“I’m excited to see all the projects that have launched during Grizzlython,” said Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs. “From payments to governance, games to finance to mobile, the builders in the Solana ecosystem are paving the way for mass adoption of blockchain technology.”
