Something big has been happening around the world — and now, there’s more coming.

The Solana Foundation Hacker Houses have come to cities across the globe to give the Solana community a place to build, meet, and show their projects. Now, the team is heading back out on the road for a slate of new, official Solana Hacker Houses as the community gets ready for [Breakpoint](https://solana.com/breakpoint?ref=solana.ghost.io), the annual Solana conference (more details coming soon!). It’s your chance to capture the magic.

Each Solana Hacker House gives builders a place to build, find collaborators, demo their work, and learn from some of the greats in the Solana ecosystem. The Solana Hacker Houses also feature everything you need to do your best work: Good WiFi, food, power, and (of course) swag.

If you’re interested in joining a Solana Hacker House, you must register ahead of time. Each house has limited capacity, so submit your application early!

Coming up on the road to Breakpoint:
