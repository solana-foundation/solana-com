### **With over 1,000 registrations & 60+ project submissions from builders globally!**

![](/uploads/builder/announcing-the-winners-of-solana-s-inaugural-hackathon/image-1.jpg)

To accelerate the already rapid growth of the ecosystem, [the Solana Foundation hosted its first online hackathon](https://solana.com/hackathon?ref=solana.ghost.io), bringing industry leaders and builders from around the world together for two weeks of hacking on Solana. Even though the event revolved around Wormhole, a new bi-directional bridge with Ethereum, participants were encouraged to build any project that could impact the ecosystem.

**Over 1,000 builders registered for the Solana Wormhole hackathon, with 60+ final project submissions spanning DeFi, Web3, NFT gaming, and core infrastructure.** Thank you to all who joined and created impactful products for the Solana ecosystem! We’d also like to thank our all-star lineup of judges and speakers who participated in [live panels](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLilwLeBwGuK5Icr4uZpDwMhtckrkSaFT0&ref=solana.ghost.io) throughout the hackathon.

Take a look at all the project submissions in the public directory at [solana.com/hackathon](http://solana.com/hackathon?ref=solana.ghost.io).

Beyond engaging with talented teams worldwide, the hackathon allowed the Solana Foundation to improve essential documentation, tooling, and other educational resources to better serve developers integrating with Solana. If you signed up for the hackathon, it would be very much appreciated if you could fill out [this brief survey](https://solanalabs.typeform.com/to/MXvvGnjw?ref=solana.ghost.io) to give additional feedback on how to improve Solana’s developer experience.

The quality and diversity of projects were impressive. However, there were 14 submissions that stood out from the rest. The projects were judged based on the following five categories: Functionality, potential impact, novelty, design, and extensibility.

So, without further ado, here are the winners of the Solana Wormhole Hackathon…

## **First Place Winners**

The four first-place winners will each receive $30,000 in USDC-SPL tokens.

**Jabber**

Jabber is a p2p messaging platform built on Solana. The app allows users to send end-to-end encrypted messages to any valid Solana address. The app converts signing keys to Curve25519 to encrypt messages. The Jabber team leveraged Solana’s high-throughput to put most of the functionality all on-chain.

**Solana Fantasy Sports**

Solana Fantasy Sports is a fully on-chain app where users can start a league by setting an entry-amount in SOL. Friends join by paying an entry fee and then choose players in the initial draft. Users can swap players during the game, and scores are published weekly by owner wallets fetched from an API. The highest scorer in each league gets to withdraw the entry-amount collected.

### **Solana Structured Products**

Structured products in traditional finance are simply a combination of two or more financial instruments that comprise a single product that pays out based on the underlying assets’ performance. The Structured Products team built a system that allows users to match and lock single deposits with the shared goal of executing a particular trading strategy, coupled with position management bots that read and respond to Serum DEX’s market data.

Once the first player has revealed their action the second player will have 10 seconds to reveal their choice as well.
