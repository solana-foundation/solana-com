Breakpoint 2024 is going to be a crypto conference unlike any other. And now, the official agenda is here.

There won’t be any panels or shilling here. The premiere Solana event of the year will be full of thought-provoking debates, game-changing keynotes, and product-focused announcements. See the full agenda.

### Left Curve, For the Culture

There are no secondary stages at Breakpoint this year. The two stages — Left Curve and Right Curve — will both be chock full of exciting programming.

Left Curve will be the stage focused on product and culture. Here’s some of the highlights you can look forward to:

- Kick things off with a conversation between Solana Labs president **Raj Gokal** and the Network State’s **Balaji Srinivasan**.
- It’s been two years since **Firedancer** was first demoed at Breakpoint 2022. When is it coming to Solana mainnet beta? Kevin Bowers of Jump Crypto will be giving an update.
- Are celebrity coins good or bad? **Eric Wall** of Taproot Wizards debates with the mother of Solana celeb tokens, **Iggy Azalea.**
- **Crypto: East vs. West!** Join a rousing debate on the strengths and differences in the blockchain world with Cindy Leow of Drift, Joanna Zeng of SOON, and Dovey Wan of Primitive Ventures.
- **Should the Solana Foundation exist at all, or should it be dissolved?** Joel John of Decetralised hosts a lively debate between Dan Albert of the Solana Foundation and Viktor Fischer of RockawayX.
- **Is Solana more future-proof than Ethereum, or will the Solana ecosystem need more L2s before it becomes more competitive?** Santiago Roel Santos of the SRS Family Office dukes it out with Avichal Garg of Electric Capital in a debate hosted by Ben Sparango of the Solana Foundation.
- Biohacker and VC extraordinaire **Bryan Johnson** of Blueprint comes on stage for an illuminating fireside chat.
- What can be done about scams and rugs? **Emily Meyers** of Electric Capital and **Mike Dudas** of 6th Man Ventures debate it out with moderator **Logan Jastremski** of Frictionless Capital.
- Stay to the end of Day 1 for a special event — the Solana Awards 👀

### Gigabrain on Right Curve

Right Curve will be a stage focused on developers and engineering. Don’t expect things to be simplified here — it’s the home of the technical deep dives, workshops, and mind-melding demos.

Here’s a sample of what you can expect:

- **How do you automatic market makers fight off sandwich attacks?** Eugene Chen of Ellipsis Labs will give a technical deep dive.
- **zk compression** is here! Swen Schaeferjohann of Light Protocol and Nicolas Pennie of Helius host a session on zero knowledge compression indexing.
- Dig into **blinks and Solana Actions** with a technical workshop hosted by the Solana Foundation's Nick Frostbutter.
- What roadmap could Solana take, and what could Solana 2.0 be? **Mert Mumtaz of Helius** hosts a fireside chat with Solana Labs’ **Anatoly Yakovenko.**

### Go Beyond the Stages

Breakpoint isn’t just about what happens on the Left and Right Curves. There will be plenty of content that happens off the agenda that will be hosted by the community.

- **The Pod,** a learning space, will host more intimate workshops and talks from teams across the Solana ecosystem.
- **The Colosseum Hackathon Arena,** a special buildspace for those participating in the Solana Radar Hackathon, will host a series of workshops, to be announced by [Colosseum](https://www.colosseum.org/breakpoint) soon.
- **The PayPal USD Learning Pod** will host developer talks about stablecoins and the future of payments in crypto.
- The Breakpoint floor will be full of **activations, events, and more crypto-powered features** from teams at the cutting edge of the Solana ecosystem.
