## **The State of the Solana Network 2022**

More than 3,700 builders came together in Lisbon for [Breakpoint](https://solana.com/breakpoint), the conference put on by the Solana Foundation. Community members from around the world came to learn, code, and recognize the accomplishments and hard work of the Solana community. The celebration was cut short a few days later, however, when news of FTX’s collapse shocked the web3 community.

We’ve published a blog post to foster transparency and answer questions related to the FTX collapse. [You can read that post here.](https://solana.com/news/solana-facts-ftx-bankruptcy)

[The Solana network remains strong](https://twitter.com/solana/status/1590500388679176195) and full of committed builders — [see for yourself.](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SolanaJourney?src=hashtag_click&ref=solana.ghost.io) Anatoly Yakovenko of Solana Labs and Austin Federa of the Solana Foundation gave the Breakpoint audience an overview of the state of the Solana network, showcasing how the ecosystem has grown over the last year. That robustness remains, with builders banding together to help each other in the wake of last week’s events, including notably [a community-run fork of Serum.](https://twitter.com/m_schneider/status/1591636078037200896)

Here’s the facts on Solana over the past year:

- **User activity.** As of October 2022, there were [11.5 million active user accounts](https://twitter.com/solana/status/1590500400364326913) on Solana, despite the market downturn (at the peak, there were 22.4 million active user accounts).
- **Developers.** The number of open source projects on Solana continues to grow, with [20,717 Github developer repositories](https://twitter.com/solana/status/1590500404877557760) as of the start of Breakpoint in early November 2022.
- **NFTs.** NFTs have exploded on Solana, with more than [21.9 million NFTs minted](https://twitter.com/solana/status/1590500412289093633) from 150,000 creators.
- **Games.** Over 1,100 gamers came to [Solana Foundation Games Day](https://twitter.com/solana/status/1590500406634975232) in Lisbon, which took place the day before Breakpoint kicked off. They played dozens of complete (or nearly complete) games in the Solana ecosystem. There are currently 15 games that are live and playable using Solana, and with 37 expected by March 2023.
- **DeFi.** [Over $150 million](https://twitter.com/solana/status/1590500410049335296) was raised by Solana DeFi projects in 2022.
- **DAOs.** At Breakpoint 2021, DAO governance did not exist on Solana. In the year since, new tooling has led to [a blossoming of DAOs on Solana,](https://twitter.com/solana/status/1590500408161714176) leading to 7,693 DAO proposals and 31,793 total votes.
- **Mobile.** [Unlocking web3 for mobile devices](https://solanamobile.com/news/getting-closer-the-mobile-era-of-web3-with-saga-and-solana-mobile-stack) continues apace. The first Saga developer kits are due to ship in December 2022, the SolanaMobile dApp Store will open in January 2023, and public devices are coming in early 2023.
