As Breakpoint 2023 comes to an end, the Breakpoint team filled with gratitude and inspired by the incredible energy, innovation, and community spirit that illuminated Amsterdam over these last five days. Here’s a look back at some of the highlights and a heartfelt thank you for being a vital part of this unforgettable event.

### Session Highlights

This year, Breakpoint was the launchpad for groundbreaking announcements and initiatives, setting a bold course for the future of the Solana ecosystem and the broader world of web3.

A full recap is coming soon, but here’s what happened on the final day.
