## **🌱 See the energy impact of a Solana transaction**

The Solana Foundation has released its first-ever energy usage report, showing the total energy impact of a Solana transaction and the ecosystem at large.

According to the most recent calculations, **a single Solana transaction takes 0.00051 kWh, or 1,836 Joules, of energy**. That is less than the energy impact of two Google Searches, and far less than normal household activities like leaving a light on for an hour, running a refrigerator, or driving a gallon of gas. It is also much, much lower than other blockchain networks like bitcoin, ethereum, and eth2.
