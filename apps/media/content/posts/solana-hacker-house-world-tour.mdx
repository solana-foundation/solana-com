Solana builders are hitting the road — and you’re invited.

Come join some of the brightest minds at Solana Labs and the developers in your own community for the official Solana Hacker House World Tour, a series of six week-long hacker houses around the globe.

Each Hacker House will give builders a place to work, find collaborators, and learn from some of the greats in the Solana ecosystem. You’ll have all the essentials: good WiFi, food, power, and (of course) swag.

If you’re interested in joining a Solana Hacker House, you must be a developer and register ahead of time. Each house has limited capacity, so submit your application early!

The world tour includes:
