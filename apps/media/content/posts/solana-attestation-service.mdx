Onboarding users to Solana just got easier. Today, the Solana Identity Group, alongside the Solana Foundation, is announcing **Solana Attestation Service (SAS)** is now live on Solana mainnet — an open, permissionless protocol for verifiable credentials. The SAS allows trusted issuers to associate off-chain information (such as KYC checks, geographic eligibility, membership in a clip, or accreditation status) with a user’s wallet. These attestations are signed, verifiable, and reusable across applications without exposing sensitive data onchain or duplicating verification steps.

By providing a neutral and permissionless attestation layer, SAS enables compliance, access control, reputation systems, and programmable identity across the Solana ecosystem. It’s a better, easier experience for both end users and builders.

## **SAS: The Trust Layer for Internet Capital Markets**

As internet capital markets on Solana grow, applications must be able to verify offchain data — such as compliance status, user uniqueness, or jurisdiction — at scale and without friction.

Today, each application often builds its own verification flows, manages sensitive user data, or relies on siloed integrations. This increases user friction, regulatory risk, and operational overhead.

The Solana Attestation Service changes that dynamic by providing:

- **Portable credentials** that users can hold within their wallet and reuse across applications.
- **Neutral, open infrastructure** that issuers, developers, and users can rely on without centralized gatekeepers.
- **Programmable trust** that applications can access with one SDK call — without needing to manage backends or identity databases.

SAS is designed to be secure by design, private by default, and composable for a wide range of blockchain use cases.

## **Core SAS Use Cases**

The Solana Attestation Service enables a wide variety of applications across financial services, DeFi, DePIN, gaming, and beyond:

- **KYC “Passports”**: Meet regulatory requirements once, reuse credentials across platforms.
- **Region-based Access Control**: Gate access to apps, assets, or drops based on jurisdiction.
- **Sybil Resistance**: Prove human uniqueness for airdrops, governance, or fair launches.
- **Accreditation Verification**: Validate investor eligibility for real-world asset platforms.
- **DAO Reputation Systems**: Build voting, contribution, or merit credentials that stay portable across communities.
- **Device or Location Attestations**: Power DePIN applications with verifiable off-chain proofs.

This is only a small snapshot of what’s possible. With SAS, you can attest to anything — and developers can focus on building better user experiences while relying on the open SAS standard.

## The Solana Identity Group

The SAS is the first project from the newly formed Solana Identity Group, a collection of teams across the Solana ecosystem. This group will be focused on building, testing, and implementing new identity primitives and specs that can be implemented by any Solana-based team.

The Solana Identity Group is:

- **Civic**, a leading identity management solution for the verifiable Internet, empowering people to privately manage their identities across chains with an onchain representation of their reusable identity.
- **Solid**, a global standard for digital identity and data self sovereignty. Verify Once. Use Anywhere.
- **Solana.ID**, an onchain reputation product that helps you to get perks from every corner of the Solana ecosystem.
- **Solana Foundation**, a Swiss nonprofit dedicated to the security, development, and growth of the greater Solana ecosystem.
- **Trusta Labs**, Matching onchain assets with the right users using AI powered sybil prevention, knowledge graph enhanced profiling, and user targeting.

If you are part of an identity-focused project that would benefit from building open source public solutions, please reach out to [identity@solana.org](mailto:identity@solana.org).

## Teams Building with SAS

### Solid

Solid integrates Solana's attestation service to enable decentralized identity and data ownership for users. By minting a “Priority Pass,” users create a unique digital identity linked to their Solana wallet. Verified credentials—such as KYC data or social profiles—are stored on-chain as attestations. Users can selectively share this data with third parties and earn tokens as rewards, incentivizing participation. Reputation scores are built from these attestations and can be enhanced through staking. This integration empowers users with privacy-preserving, transparent, and monetizable control over their identity in the Solana ecosystem.

### Solana ID

Solana ID helps you to get perks from every corner of the Solana ecosystem. Become a holder [here](https://app.solana.id) !

In addition to this, we are now integrating and utilizing Solana Attestation Service to issue career attestations and verify your work and position. By using the Solana Attestation Portal, you can now have immutable proof of your work and career, verified directly by your employer!

As a company, attesting to your employees work is not only beneficial to employees, but you can also avoid any future misrepresentation of people who did not work at your company.

### Trusta Labs

Trusta.AI is devoted to leveraging revolutionary AI innovation breakthroughs to bring fundamental changes to the entire AI + Crypto ecosystem. We believe that by bringing "more trust, less friction" in transactions, we can create a smoother and more secure digital experience for human users and AI agents.

Trusta.AI's vision is to build a Trusted Identity Network for Crypto-Intelligence (Crypto+AI). In this ecosystem that encompasses both Human Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence, using Trusta Identity as the foundation, all data, reputation, and credit will be accumulated. Ultimately, we will establish a universal credit infrastructure for all intelligences (human intelligence + artificial intelligence). But now, We believe it is time to decentralize [Trusta.AI](http://trusta.ai) for adapting to the coming of AI era.

### Civic

[Civic](https://www.civic.com/) is a leading identity management solution for the verifiable Internet, empowering people to privately manage their identities across chains with an on-chain representation of their reusable identity. Our flagship product, Civic Pass, functions as an integrated permissioning tool for business customers to allow their users to access their on-chain assets securely.

Civic Passes are verified credentials in the form of attestations. So, Civic Pass holders will be able to access the benefits of working with SAS all without any action on their part. In fact, the building for this framework has taken place entirely behind the scene, so Civic Passes will already be compatible with SAS.

[Reach out](https://www.civic.com#contact) to our team to ensure we issue SAS attestations along with your Civic Passes.

### Wecan

[Wecan](https://wecangroup.ch/) is a distributed protocol for secure data and document exchange.

We connect ledgers to trusted oracles like official registers — such as land, commercial, and shareholder registries — using the Solana Attestation Service (SAS) .

Our land register demo shows how governments can move property records to blockchain, enabling tamper-proof ownership tracking, automated validation, and seamless data sharing.

Benefits include:

- Increased trust for investors and institutions
- Operational efficiency through automated compliance

### Range

Range is the leading blockchain security and intelligence platform for the Solana and Cosmos ecosystems, working with teams like the Solana Foundation, Circle, dYdX, and Osmosis. Our products include the industry’s first [Cross-Chain Explorer](https://explorer.range.org/) – tracking activity across 50+ chains and major bridges – as well as [real-time monitoring\*\*,\*\* alerting](https://app.range.org/) , and [forensic tools](https://app.range.org/trail) used by developers, security teams, and protocols alike.

As part of our Solana Attestation Service (SAS) integration, Range is ingesting all onchain attestations. Identity attestations will enrich wallet intelligence, surfacing wallet names and labels across our tools. All other onchain attestations will be displayed during wallet investigations, giving developers and security teams deeper visibility and context for Solana accounts.

Attestations will also feature in our risk analysis engine, which powers our [Solana Transaction Security Standard](https://www.range.org/transaction-security) - the only Solana-native real-time simulation API. Learn more at [range.org](http://range.org) .

### RNS.ID

[RNS.ID](http://rns.id) , issuer of sovereign-backed digital identities via the Palau Digital Residency program, uses the Solana Attestation Service (SAS) to deliver trusted, on-chain identity verification on Solana. [RNS.ID](http://rns.id) can issue on-chain attestation to real users who have completed KYC, including attributes such as age eligibility (e.g., over 18 or 21), gender, and jurisdiction.

Discover how you can leverage RNS.ID + SAS for secure, identity-aware blockchain experiences—visit [rns.id](https://rns.id/) to get started.

### Sumsub

Sumsub is the leading IDV/KYC provider for the crypto industry, trusted by most major exchanges, on/off ramps, wallets, and other key players. We recently launched our [Reusable Identity](https://sumsub.com/sumsub-id/) , enabling users to securely store their verified KYC data and seamlessly reuse it across our client network for compliant onboarding.

Users are able to store real-world KYC data with us and seamlessly re-use it in compliant onboarding with any of our clients. They will be able to issue digital credentials associated with their profile and we’re working with SAS to showcase how an SAS attestation can be issued on the back of Sumsub KYC verification and used thereafter.

The core use case is eliminating friction for Web3 users who interact with CeFi businesses requiring AML-compliant onboarding – reducing the need to repeat KYC checks with every new platform.

### Honeycomb Protocol

Honeycomb Protocol is on a mission to enable game studios to build the next generation of gaming that leverage Solana at scale without requiring blockchain knowledge. Our SDK provides on-chain game primitives such as missions, player profiles, rewards, staking, crafting, in-game assets and badges.
