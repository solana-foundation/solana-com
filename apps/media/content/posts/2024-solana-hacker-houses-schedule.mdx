It all leads up to [Breakpoint 2024](https://solana.com/breakpoint), the annual gathering of the Solana community, happening in Singapore Sept. 19-21, 2024.

Solana Hacker Houses are opportunities for builders to gather, learn, and collaborate with the diverse and creative Solana community. Attendees can expect:

- **Learning and Development:** Participate in informative and educational programming, including workshops, panels, and presentations from industry leaders and ecosystem teams.
- **Networking:** Experience opportunities for conversation and connection. Hacker Houses are a time to work on your project, network, find team members for your idea, or join an existing team.
- **Testing Ground:** Experiment, build, and receive feedback on your ideas, plus participate in a demo day to show your work to the community.
- **Focused Topics:** Each Solana Hacker House will specialize in different, relevant areas of the blockchain industry.
