**Solana Ventures** is pleased to announce the results of Riptide, a global hackathon focused on bringing the next wave of high-impact projects into the Solana ecosystem. Riptide is the fifth Solana hackathon, and the first to take place as Solana Hacker Houses gathered builders from around the globe. The hackathon brought together crypto pioneers and developers from around the world to build projects on the Solana blockchain spanning Payments, DeFi, Gaming, DAOs, and everything in-between.

Open to teams globally, Riptide saw nearly 7000 participants submit 550 final projects to the judges. Google, Visa, Jump Crypto, Samsung NEXT, MonkeDAO, and Mango joined Solana Ventures as category sponsors for the global hackathon, offering participants a global prize pool of up to $5 million in prizes and seed funding. 

“I’m thrilled to see the projects that have started building on Solana during Riptide,” said Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs. “From payments to governance, games to finance to web3, the builders in the Solana ecosystem are paving the way for mass adoption of blockchain technology.”
