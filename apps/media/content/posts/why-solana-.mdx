The web was designed to be a place for freedom, built on a vision of permissionless participation and distributed trust on a global scale. However, the team at Solana has gradually seen this become compromised over time as additional layers of complexity have extracted value from and fragmented the overall ecosystem.

Bitcoin and Ethereum showed us that it was possible to revitalize this vision through blockchains, allowing us to create an open financial ecosystem while empowering individuals to take ownership of their data.

The goal is to ensure that not only can it be accessible to everyone, but that it can also be scalable enough to support real-world demand. For Solana, that means providing the fastest, low-fee, censorship-resistant blockchain to enable high-growth applications to democratize the world’s financial system.

## **Focus on your vision, not your infrastructure.**

Solana is a global, distributed network designed to scale natively, without sacrificing decentralization or security to support billions of users and devices.

**Never Worry About Dealing with Scale**

Solana scales natively with Moore’s Law. We don’t introduce any additional complexity through sharding or Layer 2 solutions.

**Don’t require your users to wait**

Blazing fast speeds and no mempool congestion. 400ms block times and sub-second confirmations allow for over 50,000 transactions per second. Web 3.0 with Web 2.0 speed.

**Forget about network fees**

With the ability to send 1 million transactions across the network for approximately $10 USD, users can forget about volatile and expensive transaction fees.

**Enterprise-grade security**

Audited by a Fortune 500-preferred security firm. Iron-clad immutability for global scale.

**Build-in your language**

Code in C, C++, Rust, and Move. Flexible virtual machine integrations, with more on the way.

## **Your users will never even notice.**

[Solana’s performance is unparalleled](https://break.solana.com/?ref=solana.ghost.io) and built explicitly for high-frequency and massive-scale applications.
