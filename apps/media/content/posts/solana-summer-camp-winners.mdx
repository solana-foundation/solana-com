The Solana Foundation is pleased to announce the results of the [Solana Summer Camp Hackathon](https://solana.com/summercamp?ref=solana.ghost.io) , a global competition focused on bringing the next wave of high-impact projects into the Solana ecosystem. Solana Summer Camp is the sixth Solana hackathon, and while it was primarily an online event, ecosystem teams across the world hosted thousands of participants at offline events in San Francisco, Chicago, Salt Lake City, New York City, London, Lisbon, Amsterdam, Prague, Berlin, Belgrade, and Singapore. The hackathon brought together crypto pioneers and developers from around the world to launch projects on the Solana blockchain spanning Payments, DeFi, Mobile, Gaming, DAOs, and everything in-between.
