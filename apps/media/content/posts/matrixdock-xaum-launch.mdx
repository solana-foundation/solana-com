Gold prices have climbed to record highs above $5,000 per ounce as investors around the world rush into the metal's traditional safe-haven role amid ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, including trade tensions, volatile markets, and questions about U.S. monetary policy and the strength of the dollar. At the same time, central banks and large institutional investors continue to diversify reserves away from fiat currencies toward gold, and large inflows into gold-backed ETFs signal strong investor demand for tangible assets.

The same institutional demand driving physical gold prices is now accelerating onchain, where settlement happens in seconds rather than days and gold can function as programmable collateral in DeFi protocols.

**Today, Matrixdock deploys XAUm on Solana, bringing Asia's largest tokenized gold product to one of crypto's fastest networks.**

## Institutional-Grade Tokenized Gold

Matrixdock, [a Real World Asset tokenization platform under Matrixport Group](https://www.matrixdock.com/), is expanding XAUm to Solana. Each token represents one troy ounce (31.1 grams) of 99.99% pure gold meeting London Bullion Market Association standards—securely vaulted and independently audited.

XAUm already stands as Asia's largest tokenized gold project, with physical redemption available across major Asian wealth centers including Hong Kong and Singapore. XAUm distinguishes itself through monthly attestations, proof-of-reserves reporting, and exclusive use of LBMA ecosystem gold, meeting the purity and custody standards required by institutional investors.

## DeFi Integration on Solana

Solana's architecture enables near-instant settlement and high-frequency interactions, allowing gold to function as both a store of value and a liquid onchain reserve asset. XAUm launches with initial liquidity on Raydium for decentralized trading and liquidity provisioning, with planned expansion into Solana-based lending markets where holders can use tokenized gold as collateral while maintaining full physical backing.

This is [Matrixdock's second activation](http://matrixdock.com/blog/announcements/asias-newest-crypto-hub-gelephu-mindfulness-city-partners-with-matrixdock) on Solana. In late 2025, Matrixdock also [architected the sovereign-backed gold token](https://www.finews.asia/finance/44466-bhutan-enters-the-digital-gold-era), TER, issued by Gelephu Mindfulness City of the Kingdom of Bhutan.
