Gold prices have climbed to record highs as investors respond to rising macro uncertainty including geopolitical tensions, volatile risk markets, and growing questions around U.S. monetary policy and dollar stability. At the same time, central banks and institutional allocators continue to diversify reserves away from fiat currencies toward gold, while sustained inflows into gold-backed ETFs signal strong demand for tangible assets.

That same institutional demand driving physical gold markets is now extending onchain, where gold can settle in seconds rather than days and function as programmable, balance-sheet-grade collateral on DeFi protocols.

**Today, Matrixdock deploys XAUm on Solana, bringing Asia's largest tokenized gold product to one of crypto's fastest networks.**

Each XAUm token represents one troy ounce (31.1 grams) of 99.99% pure gold meeting London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) standards. Gold is fully allocated, securely vaulted in Asia, and independently audited.

## Highlights

- **LBMA-Only Supply Chain** - Sourced, refined and vaulted within the LBMA ecosystem, working with accredited partners including Heraeus, Metalor, Brinks and Malca Amit.
- **Fully Allocated Physical Gold** - Each token is backed 1:1 by allocated physical gold. Tokenholders can independently verify holdings against underlying bar records online.
- **Asia Physical Redemption** - Physical redemption available in Singapore and Hong Kong, starting from 1kg bars, aligned with institutional bullion market standards.
- **Institutional Transparency** - Monthly vault statements are published and logged on-chain. Bi-annual audits are conducted by Bureau Veritas, auditor of GLD, the world's largest gold ETF.
- **Industry Recognition** - First gold token issuer accepted by Singapore Bullion Market Association and a member of Hong Kong Gold Exchange.

To mark the Solana deployment, Matrixdock will host an invitation-only vault access program for selected Solana ecosystem partners at Le Freeport Singapore, one of Asia's most secure and institutionally trusted precious metals vaults. Eligible ecosystem participants may express interest through Matrixdock or the Solana team for consideration.

## DeFi Integration on Solana

Solana's architecture enables near-instant settlement, allowing gold to function as both a store of value and a liquid onchain reserve asset. XAUm launches with initial liquidity on Raydium, with planned expansion into Solana-based lending markets where tokenized gold can be used as collateral while maintaining full physical backing. Over time, XAUm will integrate across Solana wallets, exchanges, and DeFi protocols.

This marks [Matrixdock's second activation](http://matrixdock.com/blog/announcements/asias-newest-crypto-hub-gelephu-mindfulness-city-partners-with-matrixdock) on Solana. In late 2025, Matrixdock also [architected the sovereign-backed gold token](https://www.finews.asia/finance/44466-bhutan-enters-the-digital-gold-era), TER, issued by Gelephu Mindfulness City of the Kingdom of Bhutan.
