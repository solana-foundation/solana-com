Today, WisdomTree brings its full suite of regulated tokenized funds to Solana.

WisdomTree, a publicly-traded asset manager managing over $116B in assets, is expanding its tokenized funds offerings to Solana. Both institutional and retail investors can now access WisdomTree's complete range of tokenized funds—money market, equities, fixed income, alternatives, and asset allocation—through the **WisdomTree Connect™** and **WisdomTree Prime®** platforms.

WisdomTree offers the largest collection of tokenized funds available to institutions. This expansion reflects growing crypto-native demand for regulated real world assets and Solana's ability to support that demand at scale.

For enterprises and institutions, Solana is now a supported blockchain within the **WisdomTree Connect™** B2B/B2B2C tokenization platform, including WisdomTree's stablecoin conversion service for subscriptions and redemptions. All existing WisdomTree tokenized funds can now be minted directly on Solana. Institutional clients can purchase, hold and manage tokenized fund positions directly on Solana, as well as use these positions within DeFi applications.

On **WisdomTree Prime®**, retail users can on-ramp USDC directly from Solana into the app and access regulated, yield-generating WisdomTree tokenized funds while remaining entirely onchain. These holdings can be off-ramped to self-custody wallets on Solana for future use in Solana applications.

## Why Solana

Solana's infrastructure focuses on high transaction speeds, allowing WisdomTree to meet growing crypto-native demand while maintaining the regulatory standards institutions expect. The network gives both institutional and retail investors more seamless, onchain access to tokenized funds.

Real world assets on Solana have surpassed $1B in total value. WisdomTree's decision to expand their full suite of tokenized funds to Solana reflects the demand for expanded access to tokenized RWAs and Solana's ability to support that demand at scale.
