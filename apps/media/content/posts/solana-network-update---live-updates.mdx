## **Solana network outage on December 4th, 2020**

At approximately 1:46pm UTC on December 4th, 2020, the Solana Mainnet Beta cluster stopped producing blocks at slot 53,180,900, which prevented any new transactions from being confirmed. The Solana team is actively working with the validator community to restart the network. No funds are at risk, and the team’s primary focus is performing a smooth restart of the network. As information unfolds, we will continue to provide updates in this post, on Discord, and on our social platforms.

**UPDATE**: As of 9:30pm UTC 12/7/20, Solana Engineers have identified the issue and are working on a post-mortem. Again, no funds are at risk and the network is functioning normally. Once the issue is fully patched and validators update to the fix, a comprehensive post-mortem will be published.

While we work on the fix, we would like to thank the passionate and diligent global network of validators who identified this issue and coordinated to restart the network.
