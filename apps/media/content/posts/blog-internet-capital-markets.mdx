### **TL;DR**

Compounding infrastructure improvements are scaling Solana to serve global markets:

- Solana block capacity expanded by 25% this year, with [Solana Improvement Document (SIMD)](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/286) proposals for another 66% increase planned for later this year
- A new Token Program rewrite ([P-token SIMD](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/266)) reduces transaction compute requirements of Solana’s most used program by over 95%
- Jump’s [Firedancer](https://jumpcrypto.com/firedancer/) validator client has demonstrated 1M+ TPS in testing and 100k TPS on mainnet
- [Alpenglow](http://www.anza.xyz/blog/alpenglow-a-new-consensus-for-solana), a new Solana consensus protocol proposed by Anza Research promises sub 150ms median finality

## Global Financial Infrastructure for Internet Capital Markets

Internet Capital Markets are here and in full force on Solana. Last quarter, Solana processed 8.5 billion transactions, more than all other chains combined ([source: Artemis)](https://app.artemisanalytics.com/asset/solana?from=assets&tab=metrics&category=KEY_METRICS&metric=CHAIN_TXNS). Here are just a few notable highlights from that period:

- Raydium DEX realized $1 Trillion in lifetime volume
- Pump.fun token launch: $600 million raised. 12 minutes.
- xStocks debuted, already exceeding $2B in tokenized stock trading volume

The future of finance is unfolding right now, and the Solana community is systematically enhancing the infrastructure to support it. These improvements are building toward one inevitable outcome: a financial system where every market for every asset operates with the speed and accessibility of the internet.

## **More Block Capacity:** [SIMD-0207](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/207)**,** [SIMD-0256](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/256)**, and** [SIMD-0286](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/286)

Solana measures capacity in Compute Units (CUs), the computational work needed to process transactions. This year, the network expanded from 48 million to 60 million CUs per block, a 25% throughput increase. For context and scale, a typical token transfer uses about 5,000 CU, so that change alone enables the network to process about 2,500 additional token transfers per block.

Next stop? 100M! A Solana Improvement Document Proposal (SIMD) outlines a plan to increase another 66% by end of year:

Each upgrade proves itself under real-world load before the next expansion, maintaining velocity without compromising reliability.

## **Increased Efficiency: P-Token**

The Solana SPL Token Program is integral to many common activities on the platform, including DeFi swaps, lending, NFT marketplaces, stablecoin payments, airdrops, and more. The Program processes over 1.5 million transactions hourly (nearly 40% of Solana’s non-vote transactions).

**_Source:_** [_Dune Analytics_](https://dune.com/queries/5638809/9163673)

Because most transactions actually include multiple invocations of the SPL Token Program, the network consistently processes over 200M SPL Token instructions daily.

At this scale, even small efficiency gains compound into massive capacity increases. Enter [P-Token](https://github.com/solana-program/token/tree/main/p-token), a ground-up rewrite of the SPL Token Program that achieves dramatic efficiency gains while performing the same underlying actions.

To be clear: this isn't a new token program. P-Token is a drop-in code replacement for the existing SPL Token Program. All current functionality remains intact, meaning no changes to how you interact with tokens, wallets, or DeFi protocols. Your existing tokens, accounts, and integrations continue working exactly as they do today.

Under the hood, P-Token eliminates unnecessary data copying, reduces memory usage, and streamlines execution paths. The efficiency gains across all operations are massive:

**_P-token Compute Saving for Some Common Token Instructions_**

| Operation      | Current CUs | P-Token CUs | Improvement      |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Token Transfer | 4,645       | 249         |                  |
| MintTo         | 4538        | 155         | \> 95% reduction |
| Burn           | 4753        | 168         |                  |

**_P-Token delivers similar 95%+ efficiency gains across all 20+ token operations._**

In [Neodyme’s](https://neodyme.io/en/) audit of P-Token, they replayed 9 days of actual mainnet transactions, simulating how the upgraded program would have performed under real conditions (in lieu of the existing program). The findings were striking: P-Token would have slashed the network's total compute consumption by 12% ( [source](https://x.com/Neodyme/status/1958234163376717904) ). This isn't just a marginal improvement—it's the equivalent of adding an extra 5 million CUs of capacity to every block (enough to handle an additional 20,000 p-token transfers) without any hardware upgrades.

In practice, this translates to:

- Lower fees: Reduced compute usage means lower priority-related transaction fees (estimate your savings with [this tool](https://ptoken.sendai.fun/) from SendAI)
- Better composability: More headroom enables more sophisticated cross-program interactions
- Higher landing rates: Abundant compute headroom improves transaction landing reliability across the network

## **More Throughput, Sub-Second Finality**

Solana has never settled for 'fast enough.’ Ecosystem engineers are working on two major upgrades that are going to transform Solana’s transaction throughput and finality latency.

Firedancer is a new client written from the ground up in C++ and maintained by [Jump Crypto](https://jumpcrypto.com/). In testing, the new client has demonstrated:

- 1.2M transactions per second (~100x current mainnet) with geographically distributed nodes
- 6-8 million signature verifications/second

<video url="https://youtu.be/AkqCgmgFxEM " />

The transition is happening gradually through "Frankendancer," a hybrid deployment of Firedancer and Agave clients. It already represents about 28% of testnet stake and 10% of mainnet stake with stable operation since mid-2024. A Frakendancer validator recently [demonstrated](https://x.com/cavemanloverboy/status/1957091396953034966) a burst of 100,000 TPS on Solana’s mainnet.

Alpenglow is the biggest change to Solana's core protocol since launch. It is a complete replacement of Solana's consensus system (the mechanism that allows thousands of validators worldwide to agree on transaction order). The upgrade aims to reduce transaction finality from 12.8 seconds to under 150ms. At these speeds, Solana could realize Web2-level responsiveness with L1 finality, unlocking new use cases that require both speed and cryptographic certainty.

Alpenglow is actively being considered by the Community. Check out [SIMD 0326](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/326) to vote on its future and join the discussion [here](https://forum.solana.com/t/simd-0326-proposal-for-the-new-alpenglow-consensus-protocol/4236/50).

Combined with Firedancer's throughput gains, the practical implications are transformative:

- For traders: Sub-second execution with cryptographic finality for price-sensitive strategies
- For applications: Responsive interfaces that feel native, not blockchain-constrained
- For users: Instant feedback with mathematical certainty, not probabilistic confidence

## Internet-Speed Finance

The compounding effect of these initiatives and the many others in the Solana ecosystem is financial infrastructure that operates at internet speed.

At this scale and speed, entirely new categories of financial applications become possible.

- Real-time global price discovery across every asset class simultaneously
- Composable financial products where complex multi-step transactions execute reliably at scale
- Micro-transaction economies that unlock entirely new product verticals
- Institutional-grade settlement that rivals traditional financial rails

These achievements aren't accidental. They are milestones in a [roadmap toward Internet Capital Markets](https://www.anza.xyz/blog/the-internet-capital-markets-roadmap), where every financial instrument operates with the speed and accessibility of the internet itself. The improvements highlighted here represent just a fraction of the engineering momentum across the ecosystem. Teams are advancing everything from network packet processing to market microstructure optimization, each improvement compounding to power infrastructure capable of serving global markets.

Every asset and every market on a single state machine, distributed around the world, synchronized at the speed of light. That's Solana.
