The sun is out, and Solana developers are building.

As Solana Summer returns once again, the Solana Foundation is pleased to announce the next batch of Solana x Jump Hacker Houses! This successful series of weeklong, in-person events have seen thousands of builders around the world meet up, learn, collaborate, and ship the next generation of web3 projects.

Thanks to the support of Jump, the Solana Foundation is pleased to announce a special European tour for builders across the continent. From the Danube to the Thames, Solana developers can expect one-of-a-kind education, mentorship, and networking opportunities with the builders in their own community.

The Solana x Jump Hacker Houses are heading to…
