Are you ready? The Solana x Jump Hacker Houses are on the Road to Breakpoint and you’re invited!

The Solana Foundation, with the support of Jump, are pleased to bring one more batch of Solana Hacker Houses to the world before the [Solana Breakpoint](https://solana.com/breakpoint) conference this November. There’s nothing like these unique building experiences, where thousands of devs from around the world meet to vibe, build, and mint the next generation of the internet together.

It all leads up to [Breakpoint](https://solana.com/breakpoint), the gathering of the Solana community in Lisbon, Portugal running Nov. 4-7th, 2022 — where there will be one more Solana Hacker House before learning and celebrating with the community at large!

The Road to Breakpoints goes through...
