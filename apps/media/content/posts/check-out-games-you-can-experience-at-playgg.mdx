## **Bladerite**

[Bladerite](https://www.theseeds.io/?ref=solana.ghost.io) is a free-to-play genre blending Battle Royale and MOBA game where players are dropped into a map and have to farm and fight for resources to be the last warrior standing while the map continuously gets smaller. Final survivors will win a considerable amount of rewards.

Some notable features of Bladerite include:

- Free-to-Play: No requirement to purchase assets prior to playing
- No Tokenomics: No cryptocurrency of any kind will be issued for Bladerite
- Bladerite Loot Mode: Core game mode for play-to-earn where players can monetize by winning the game and selling the loot on the built marketplace

Since its launch in open beta test on April 24, the game from Seed Labs studio has been steadily growing. Seed Labs and G2 Esports will collaborate with PlayGG to host an IRL tournament for Bladerite, offering a prize pool of $5,000. Everyone has a chance to win.

The Star Atlas team recently released a new technical showcase, called SAGE: Escape Velocity, featuring a novel approach to on-chain game movement. In the first six weeks after the Escape Velocity debut, the game logged more than 30 million on-chain transactions. You can check out SAGE and their other releases at PlayGG.

The steps you take every day power your journey through the Genoverse as you explore, battle, and evolve — earning rewards while you play. The game is built around bonding with your digital pet and taking care of it every day by taking care of yourself. It regularly ranks among the most active apps on Solana.

## **Aurory**

[Aurory](https://aurory.io/?ref=solana.ghost.io) is an immersive platform consisting of multiple interoperable games and dApps, where players can hatch, trade, and battle collectible creatures called Nefties. The platform’s first live game, Aurory Tactics, is a competitive turn-based PvP strategy game currently in open alpha. In this game, opponents battle their teams of three Neftie creatures against each other for rewards and glory.

Recently, the team also launched a small, pre-alpha experience of their second game in active development, called Aurory Adventures. This game aims to capture more of the MMORPG audience, where players will be able to explore an open world, completing quests and defeating enemies. The full release date for Aurory Adventures is still TBD, but PlayGG attendees will be able to experience some early roadmap pieces live at PlayGG!
