Day 2 is done! On this second day of Breakpoint, the Solana Campus was brimming with activity — you can really see how the Solana community has come from all over the world to bring Breakpoint to life. In case you missed it, here’s what happened on Day 2.

### Session Highlights

- At the Innovator Stage, it was Neodyme Security Day — a whole day of talks and panels dedicated to security.
