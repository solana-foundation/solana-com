The Solana community has been celebrating all month long. [Check out all the virtual panels and workshops](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLilwLeBwGuK5Ufxsoo14bZ8sIby3ExgRx&ref=solana.ghost.io) and keep up with the latest [over at Devpost](https://ignition.devpost.com/?ref=solana.ghost.io).

## **🦍 DegenApesAcademy votes for student council, launches DAOO**

The votes are in, and class is now in session. The Degenerate Ape Academy officially launched their DAOO — and with it, the inaugural members of their student council.
