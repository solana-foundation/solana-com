**Today, we are releasing the [DFlow Prediction Markets API](https://pond.dflow.net/concepts/prediction/prediction-markets), the first tokenization layer bringing Kalshi’s prediction markets to Solana.**

## **A New API for Prediction Markets on Solana**

[**DFlow**](http://dflow.net/) is the most powerful trading infrastructure on Solana, enabling applications to access the cutting edge of financial markets.

The DFlow Prediction Markets API gives builders a direct, programmatic way to access tokenized Kalshi markets on Solana, delivering the deepest liquidity, the broadest market coverage, and the full composability expected from onchain assets.

This is the first and only API to offer real tokenization of Kalshi prediction markets with 100% market coverage, native composability, and flexible redemptions of correct predictions in multiple stablecoins.

Prediction markets allow anyone to trade a belief against another trader, something that has not been possible at global scale \- until now. Across countless use cases, prediction markets have proven to be one of the highest-fidelity mechanisms humans have for forecasting the future.

With this release, prediction markets become a first-class citizen in the Solana ecosystem.

## **Kalshi: Pioneering Prediction Markets**

Founded in 2018, Kalshi made history as the first federally regulated exchange for trading on event outcomes. In 2020, Kalshi received [approval](https://news.kalshi.com/p/kalshi-designation) from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a designated contract market, establishing Kalshi as the first regulated financial exchange dedicated to event contracts.

That oversight brought legitimacy and opened the door for institutional participants, leading to deeper liquidity and real utility.

Everything took place in a secure, regulated environment, proving that:

Legitimacy → Liquidity → Utility.

## **Why Tokenization Matters**

Tokens are the most important financial primitive that unlock new possibilities. By tokenizing prediction markets, DFlow enables:

- **Composability:** seamless interaction with all other onchain financial primitives.

- **Interoperability:** integration with the full universe of Solana liquidity.

- **Permissionless Innovation:** open experimentation for builders without gatekeepers.

- **Expanded Design Space:** a massively broadened creative canvas, limited only by imagination.

Once a prediction becomes an SPL token, it gains all the composability of Solana DeFi. It can be borrowed, lent, used as liquidity (LP’d), swapped, collateralized, automated, or integrated into entirely new trading architectures.

Tokenizing predictions is how the next chapter of finance gets built.

## **How DFlow Implements Tokenization**

To turn predictions into tokens, DFlow uses **Concurrent Liquidity Programs (CLPs)**, a new Solana-native framework built by DFlow that bridges offchain liquidity with onchain users. CLPs allow traders to write trade intents onchain and have those orders filled asynchronously by liquidity providers.

This architecture introduces a multi-transaction model for trading. CLPs enable on-demand minting of tokenized prediction positions at tight prices, directly on Solana.

CLPs also allow for high-frequency minting and burning of tokens, and permissionless, onchain trading of these assets.

In essence, CLPs are the entry point for tokenization in this system. They enable Solana users to interact with Kalshi offchain liquidity natively using SPL tokens.

This works as follows:

1. Solana users define intent onchain (e.g. place a limit order for a given outcome).

2. LPs observe these intents and fill at or better than the expressed limit.

3. The protocol mints tokens representing the purchased prediction position.

4. When the market resolves, settlement flows back through the CLP, redeeming the winning tokens for their payout.

## **Introducing the DFlow Prediction Markets API**

The DFlow Prediction Markets API is the **fastest**, most **complete**, and most **composable** way to access Kalshi liquidity on Solana.

With this API, developers can integrate real prediction market tokens from Kalshi into any Solana application.

Key features include:

- **100% Market Coverage:** all Kalshi markets are available as tokenized markets on Solana.

- **Real SPL Tokens:** positions are actual Solana tokens (not synthetic exposures) for true onchain ownership.

- **Best Execution via JIT Routing:** integration with DFlow’s just-in-time router ensures optimal pricing and low slippage.

- **Solana-Native Compatibility:** seamless compatibility with Solana’s DeFi ecosystem (DEXs, lending protocols, wallets, etc.).

DFlow has built the most powerful onchain tokenization layer for Kalshi, and Kalshi is backing the ecosystem with a $2M grants program to fund new applications built on top.

With the DFlow Prediction Markets API, any Solana builder can add prediction markets directly into their application.

This is the beginning of a permissionless blueprint for onchain forecasting, trading, and market-driven truth discovery.

## **Conclusion**

Prediction markets capture something profound: they convert beliefs into prices, opinions into action, and uncertainty into clarity.

Kalshi built the largest and most trusted prediction marketplace in the world. Now, DFlow is bringing it onchain with true tokenization, full coverage, and infinite composability.

The DFlow Prediction Markets API is more than an integration. It’s the new programmable substrate for forecasting on the internet, powered by Kalshi and anchored on Solana.

The future is now live on Solana: tokenized, composable, and ready to build on with DFlow.
