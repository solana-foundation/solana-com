**_SAN FRANCISCO_** _– June 25, 2024_ – The Solana Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the Solana network's decentralization, adoption, and security, today announced the launch of Solana Actions and blockchain links (blinks) to its suite of developer tools. These tools offer way to integrate blockchain transactions into any platform, creating a seamless and intuitive web3 experience for users

Solana Actions allow users to execute onchain transactions across various platforms, including websites, social media, and physical QR codes. Actions make it simple for developers to integrate everything you can do in the Solana ecosystem right into their applications.

Solana blinks turn any Action into a shareable link, allowing any website that can display a URL to be the start of a Solana transaction. As a result, blinks transform websites or social media platforms into a surface for on-chain transactions, without taking users elsewhere – making decentralized applications more accessible and user-friendly.

“Access to blockchain protocols has long been isolated to dApps and other wallet-aware tools. Now, Actions and blinks on Solana allow any website and application on the internet to be a distribution point for onchain interactions – furthering the goal of mainstream adoption,” said Jon Wong, Head of Ecosystem Engineering at the Solana Foundation. “These simple-yet-powerful tools bring blockchain to everyone, everywhere by lowering the barriers to entry and paving the way for broader adoption of blockchain-based transactions.”

"Actions and blinks deliver on one of the internet's original promises: they make experiences portable, shareable, and actionable on any surface. From your X feed you can buy a NFT, tip a creator, receive money, vote, stake, swap and so much more." says Chris Osborn, Founder of Dialect. "Our mission at Dialect is to give developers the best tools to create these experiences for their users. We can't wait to see what the community builds with it."

Solana Actions and blinks are available immediately for businesses to integrate into their current offerings. Detailed documentation and support are provided here to assist developers in getting started.
