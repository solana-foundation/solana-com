Solana Ventures is pleased to announce the results of [IGNITION](https://ignition.devpost.com/), a global hackathon focused on Web3, DeFi, Gaming, and Digital Art & Collectable NFTs. IGNITION is the fourth Solana hackathon, and the third and final one to take place this year. From August 31st to October 15th, the hackathon brought together crypto pioneers and developers from around the world to build projects on the Solana blockchain, supercharging what became known as ‘Solana Summer’. 

Open to teams globally, IGNITION saw nearly 6,000 participants submit 568 final projects to the judges. Microsoft, Jump Crypto, Standard Chartered, Forte, and Metaplex joined Solana Ventures as category sponsors for the global hackathon, offering participants a global prize pool of **up to $5 million** in prizes and seed funding.

“The Solana ecosystem experienced amazing growth over this past year, and the IGNITION hackathon has been an exciting showcase of some of the best teams building in blockchain,” said Anatoly Yakovenko, CEO of Solana Labs. “We are thrilled to have these incredible projects building on Solana and look forward to seeing them evolve.”

## **Disclaimer**

The IGNITION Hackathon is a competition where projects will be evaluated by judges on their technological merits without consideration of legal viability. Participants in the Hackathon will create software solely for purposes of evaluation by judges as part of a competition and not for commercial deployment or release as part of the Hackathon. All participants must comply with applicable laws and regulations when releasing any software that they develop as part of the Hackathon.

The Hackathon ideas and developer resources that Solana Ventures (“SV”) provides are for educational and inspirational purposes only. SV does not encourage, induce or sanction the deployment of any such applications in violation of applicable laws or regulations. SV does not encourage, induce or sanction the deployment, integration or use of any such applications (including the code comprising the Solana blockchain protocol) in violation of applicable laws or regulations and hereby prohibits any such deployment, integration or use. This includes use of any such applications by the reader (a) in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction, (b) if the reader is located in or ordinarily resident in a country or territory subject to comprehensive sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), (c) if the reader is or is working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions, or (d) in violation of the Commodities and Exchange Act.

The reader should be aware that U.S. export control and sanctions laws prohibit U.S. persons (and other persons that are subject to such laws) from transacting with persons in certain countries and territories or that are on the SDN list. As a project based primarily on open-source software, it is possible that such sanctioned persons may nevertheless bypass prohibitions, obtain the code comprising the Solana blockchain protocol (or other project code or applications) and deploy, integrate, or otherwise use it. Accordingly, there is a risk to individuals that other persons using the Solana blockchain protocol may be sanctioned persons and that transactions with such persons would be a violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions law. This risk applies to individuals, organizations, and other ecosystem participants that deploy, integrate, or use the Solana blockchain protocol code directly (e.g., as a node operator), and individuals that transact on the Solana blockchain through light clients, third party interfaces, and/or wallet software. [Participation Terms](https://ignition.devpost.com/rules)
