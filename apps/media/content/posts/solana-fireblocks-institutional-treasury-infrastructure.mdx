## The Treasury Optimization Challenge

Modern enterprise treasury operations face significant headwinds. Idle cash earns sub-1% yields while inflation erodes value, with banks typically offering just 0.1-0.5% returns. Settlement friction compounds the problem—cross-border payments take 3-5 days and lock up millions in nostro accounts. Meanwhile, operational complexity drains resources through manual reconciliation, wallet pre-funding for gas, and fragmented payment rails.

## The Solution: Institutional-Grade Infrastructure

Solana and Fireblocks have partnered to deliver a complete treasury operating system that moves at internet speed while maintaining enterprise-grade controls.

### Solana Delivers the Performance Layer

Solana provides the raw infrastructure performance that treasury operations demand:

- **High-throughput processing**: 1,295 TPS with 400ms slot times
- **Stablecoin hub**: $15.7B in stablecoins with 300%+ YoY growth, establishing Solana as the primary settlement layer for digital dollars
- **Predictable costs**: Sub-cent transaction costs that remain stable even during 2x traffic spikes
- **Always-on infrastructure**: 24/7 treasury operations without banking hours limitations

### Fireblocks Delivers the Enterprise Control Layer

Fireblocks unlocks Solana's potential for enterprise treasury through three integrated features:

**Native Program Calls** provide real-time transaction transparency and policy enforcement for all Solana smart contract operations. Treasury teams can whitelist programs, track operations, and avoid third-party risks.

**Gasless Transactions** centralize fee management so teams don't need to pre-fund multiple wallets with SOL—streamlining payments and supporting compliance for regulated entities.

**The Tokenization Engine** enables businesses to issue Solana-based tokens with advanced compliance and privacy controls, managing supply and distribution for stablecoins or fund tokens.

## Partner Value Proposition

Together, Solana and Fireblocks deliver a complete treasury operating system:

- **Stablecoin yield strategies**: Generate 4-12% APY on treasury balances vs. 0.1-0.5% from traditional banking
- **Real-time liquidity management**: Automated sweeping, rebalancing, and cross-border settlement in minutes vs. days
- **Programmable treasury operations**: Fireblocks Automation combined with Solana's native speed and cost advantages
- **Seamless payment rails**: Merchant settlements, payroll, and vendor payments at less than $0.01 per transaction

## Proven Under Pressure: The October 2024 Stress Test

On October 10, 2024, the crypto market experienced the largest liquidation event in history—a real-world stress test for blockchain infrastructure.

### The Challenge

- $19.5 billion liquidated across all markets
- Approximately $1 trillion total market cap wiped
- Competitors struggled: Binance halted trading, Ethereum L2s lagged, Arbitrum median fees hit $115+

### Solana's Response

The network demonstrated remarkable resilience:

- **100,000 TPS** of inbound traffic processed by validators
- **6,000-10,000 sustained TPS** throughout—6x normal peak traffic
- **Sub-penny median fees** maintained (vs. Ethereum's $100+)
- **400ms block times** preserved without degradation
- **800+ validators** processed without failures
- **Zero payment interruption** for enterprise operations

### What This Means for Treasury Operations

When $19.5 billion in liquidations hit and competitors failed, Solana processed enterprise payments without interruption at sub-cent costs. This proves:

- **Reliable payment rails**: Network maintained operations during maximum stress when enterprise needs are highest
- **Predictable costs**: Fees stayed below $0.01 even at 6x demand—critical for treasury planning and budgeting
- **Mission-critical reliability**: The infrastructure enterprises need when it matters most
