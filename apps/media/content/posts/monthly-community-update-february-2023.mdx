## **Builders keep flocking to Solana — with more coming during Solana Grizzlython**

It’s a new year — but the builders on Solana keep building. At least that’s what the January 2022 edition of the [Electric Capital Developer Report says.](https://solana.com/2023outlook)

The report, which looked at developer activity across the web3 industry, found [more than 2,000 developers building on Solana in 2022](https://mobile.twitter.com/solana/status/1615398642717687842) — second in developer activity only to the Ethereum ecosystem, and up 83% from the year before. The entire Solana ecosystem has seen a 16x growth in the number of full-time developers since 2018.

Electric Capital notes that developer activity on Solana tends to spike around hackathons and other events, as new teams sprint to launch their projects and take advantage of the prize pot. That’s why now is the perfect time to start building and fight the bear.

On Feb. 2, the Solana Foundation kicked off **Grizzlython**, the latest Solana hackathon with $5 million in prizes and seed funding up for grabs. Projects go from ideas to fully-fledged companies during a six week sprint — with special prizes and a demo day for the winners.

In addition to a competition-wide Grand Champion with a $50,000 USDC award, Grizzlython will award prizes across seven tracks core to the growing Solana ecosystem — Mobile, DeFi, Payments, Web3 Consumer, Tools + Infrastructure, Gaming, and DAOs + Network States. Projects must be submitted by March 14.

The devs are on Solana. Are you ready to join them?
