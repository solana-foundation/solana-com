Get ready. The wave is coming.

Solana Ventures is excited to announce [Riptide](https://solana.com/riptide?ref=solana.ghost.io), a global Solana hackathon with up to $5 million in prizes and seed funding. The fifth Solana hackathon will run Feb. 2 - Mar. 17th, 2022. Anyone interested in building a project on Solana is encouraged to register.

As the current of developers and builders continues to flow towards the Solana blockchain, Riptide will focus on encouraging new projects in the payments, DeFi, web3, gaming, and DAO space. Builders can expect talks, workshops, resources, and the encouragement of the greater Solana community. The previous Solana hackathon, [IGNITION](https://solana.com/news/solana-ignition-hackathon-winners?ref=solana.ghost.io), saw more than 6,000 participants build 568 projects.

In addition to a series of online events, the Solana Foundation is also sponsoring a series of [Solana Hacker Houses](https://solana.com/news/solana-hacker-house-world-tour?ref=solana.ghost.io) so Riptide participants can build in person. Each Hacker House will give builders a place to work, find collaborators, and learn from some of the greats in the Solana ecosystem. Hacker Houses will be hosted in Los Angeles, Seattle, Singapore, Dubai, Moscow, Hong Kong, and Prague.

Projects will be eligible for:

- **The Grand Champion**, which will receive $65,000 USDC, three passes to an upcoming Solana conference, and the chance to present their projects to the greater Solana community;
- **The Community Choice Award**, voted on by the Solana community, will be awarded $10,000 USDC and an exclusive NFT;
- **Prizes in the Payments, DeFi, Web3, Gaming, and DAO Tracks**, with five prizes in each ranging from $50,000 USDC to $10,000 USDC;
- **Company Prizes**, a $30,000 USDC prize awarded to the best integration with Serum, Marinade, Friktion, and more.

The Solana Riptide Hackathon (the “Hackathon”) is a competition where projects will be evaluated by judges on their technological merits without consideration of legal viability. Participants in the Hackathon will create software solely for purposes of evaluation by judges as part of a competition and not for commercial deployment or release as part of the Hackathon. All participants must comply with applicable laws and regulations when releasing any software that they develop as part of the Hackathon.

The Hackathon ideas and developer resources that Solana Ventures (“SV”) provides are for educational and inspirational purposes only. SV does not encourage, induce or sanction the deployment of any such applications in violation of applicable laws or regulations. SV does not encourage, induce or sanction the deployment, integration or use of any such applications (including the code comprising the Solana blockchain protocol) in violation of applicable laws or regulations and hereby prohibits any such deployment, integration or use. This includes use of any such applications by the reader (a) in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction, (b) if the reader is located in or ordinarily resident in a country or territory subject to comprehensive sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), (c) if the reader is or is working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions, or (d) in violation of the Commodities and Exchange Act.

The reader should be aware that U.S. export control and sanctions laws prohibit U.S. persons (and other persons that are subject to such laws) from transacting with persons in certain countries and territories or that are on the SDN list. As a project based primarily on open-source software, it is possible that such sanctioned persons may nevertheless bypass prohibitions, obtain the code comprising the Solana blockchain protocol (or other project code or applications) and deploy, integrate, or otherwise use it. Accordingly, there is a risk to individuals that other persons using the Solana blockchain protocol may be sanctioned persons and that transactions with such persons would be a violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions law. This risk applies to individuals, organizations, and other ecosystem participants that deploy, integrate, or use the Solana blockchain protocol code directly (e.g., as a node operator), and individuals that transact on the Solana blockchain through light clients, third party interfaces, and/or wallet software.
