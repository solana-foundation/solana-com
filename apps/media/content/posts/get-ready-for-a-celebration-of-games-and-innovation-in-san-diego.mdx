**Laddercaster**

[Laddercaster](https://www.laddercaster.com/) is a mobile-first, ladder-ranking strategy game and NFT player-to-player market built on Solana. The goal of the game is for players to level up their spellcasters, from level 1 to level 30, before the next ladder (season) begins. Each character is an NFT, which can gain skills, find and equip items, or craft using materials gathered during each turn.

Check out the Laddercaster trailer [here](https://twitter.com/LadderCaster/status/1520782700264800260).

**Mega Road**

[Mega Road](https://megaroad.io/) is the first game being released under [Project Fidelion](https://fidelion.io/), an NFT project focused on storytelling and art, set in a post-apocalyptic world. Project Fidelion revolves around a dystopian story based on the idea of "One empire, Nine factions, and One story (\\191)".

Mega Road is directed by Hokyo Lim, a founding member of Riot Games. The team is building a casual, mobile Rogue-like ARPG game with unique art and music and players at PlayGG can get free digital assets!

**Portals**

[Portals](https://theportal.to/) is an ever-evolving games universe. In Story Mode, players move into a residence, earn coins, complete quests, collect items, craft, decorate, and expand their city. In Creative Mode, players can create and share worlds, games and experiences: theme parks, treasure islands, obstacle courses, RPGs, dungeon crawlers, or anything else they can imagine! All with an easy-to-use drag and drop interface.

Portals works in the browser, so you can just send a link to a friend and immediately collect, play and build together. In development since 2021, Portals is in early access, and playable in the browser now.

**Project Eluüne**

[Project Eluüne’s StarGarden](https://www.projecteluune.com/) is a team-based, auto-chess battler with RPG mechanics for PC and mobile.

In merging innovative play-and-own mechanics with the power of communal engagement, Project Eluüne is bringing players an opportunity to explore a tightly woven story-universe alongside a tribe of their closest friends. Players can claim one of 4,445 StarGardens, which serve as the home base and social hub for their tribe. Between completing quests and winning TvT battles, players strategize alongside their community to best optimize their creatures – all while unraveling the mysteries of Eleriah.

**Vital XP**

[Lowlife Forms](https://www.vitalxp.io/) is an evolutive, episodic and customizable web3 shooter that blends gunplay and magic. Set in a tongue-and-cheek universe at the intersection of science fantasy and the underground criminal world, LLF will take you on a journey from gladiator games to heroic heists, monster hunting and cosmic smuggling.

LLF’s first episode, The Can, is a PvPvE round-based arena shooter where each round differs from the previous through a groundbreaking NFT modding mechanic.

Built on Unreal 5 and Solana, and developed by Vital XP, a team of AAA-game veterans (Call of Duty, Ratchet & Clank, Marvel, Quake, Wolfenstein, etc.), Lowlife Forms is a high-fidelity, narratively driven, action-packed game like web3 has never seen.
