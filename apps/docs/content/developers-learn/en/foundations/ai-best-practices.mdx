## Key practices

- Treat AI output as a draft, not source of truth.
- Validate all account constraints and authority checks manually.
- Reproduce generated code paths with tests before shipping.
- Keep prompts and outputs in version control for team review.

## Practical workflow

1. Ask AI for a narrow, testable code change.
2. Run static checks and tests.
3. Compare generated logic against protocol docs.
4. Iterate with explicit failure cases.

## Next step

Foundations is the current POC scope. More courses will be added in the next
iteration.
