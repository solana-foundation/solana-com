## Project goal

Ship a minimal hello-world style Solana project and execute it successfully.

## Milestones

1. Initialize the project structure.
2. Implement the smallest useful instruction.
3. Execute the instruction and inspect the result.
4. Verify expected state changes.

## Reuse from quick start: read account state

Before moving to larger projects, reuse the exact account-read workflow from
[`/docs/intro/quick-start/reading-from-network`](/docs/intro/quick-start/reading-from-network).

```ts title="Read wallet account info"
import { Keypair, Connection, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL } from "@solana/web3.js";

const keypair = Keypair.generate();
const connection = new Connection("http://localhost:8899", "confirmed");

const signature = await connection.requestAirdrop(
  keypair.publicKey,
  LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
);
await connection.confirmTransaction(signature, "confirmed");

const accountInfo = await connection.getAccountInfo(keypair.publicKey);
console.log(accountInfo);
```

Use this output to validate these fundamentals:

- `executable` is `false` for wallet accounts.
- `owner` is the System Program for wallet accounts.
- `lamports` reflects the funded balance.
- `space` is `0` for system wallets with no custom data.

## Verification

- The program runs without runtime errors.
- Transaction confirmation is successful.
- Expected output/state is visible in logs or account data.
