description: Process payments at scale with gasless transactions and fee abstraction
---

Processing payments at scale—payroll, merchant payouts, loyalty rewards—requires more than sending individual transfers.

To process many payments efficiently:

1. **Batch instructions** into single transactions to reduce fees and latency ([See Batch Payments](/docs/payments/send-payments/batch-payments))
2. **Batch transactions** to parallelize throughput across the network ([Instruction/Transaction Planners](https://www.solanakit.com/docs/concepts/instruction-plans))
3. **Sponsor gas fees** so users never need to hold SOL ([See Fee Sponsorship](/docs/payments/send-payments/sponsor-transaction-fee))


## Process Gasless Payments
Every Solana transaction requires SOL for network fees. Users coming to your application expect to pay with (or receive) a stablecoin, not manage a second token balance. Abstracting fees away removes this friction.
Use [Kora](https://launch.solana.com/products/kora). It handles fee abstraction so users never need SOL. This enables you to fully sponsor fees or accept fee payment in any token.

Kora is a JSON-RPC server that can be easily configured to your needs and deployed with a single command from the Kora CLI:


```bash
cargo install kora-cli
kora --config path/to/kora.toml rpc start --signers-config path/to/signers.toml
```

And then you can use the Kora client to sign and send transactions:

```bash
pnpm add @solana/kora
```

```typescript
import { KoraClient } from "@solana/kora";

const kora = new KoraClient({ rpcUrl: "https://your-kora-instance" });

const { signature } = await kora.signAndSendTransaction({
  transaction: base64EncodedTransaction
});
```
