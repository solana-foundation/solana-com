description: Learn how fee sponsorship works and implement gasless payments with Kora.
---

Every Solana transaction requires SOL to pay network fees. But users coming to your payment application expect to transact in stablecoins—not manage a second token balance. Gasless payments remove this friction by having someone else pay the fees.

This guide covers two levels:
1. **How fee sponsorship works** — the underlying Solana primitive
2. **Gasless at scale with Kora** — a production-ready fee abstraction service

## How Fee Sponsorship Works

Solana transactions have a designated fee payer—the account that pays the network fee. By default, this is the first signer. But you can specify a different account as the fee payer, allowing a third party (the "sponsor") to cover fees on behalf of the sender.

Both the sender and sponsor must sign the transaction:
- The **sender** signs to authorize the transfer of their tokens
- The **sponsor** signs to authorize payment of the network fee

## !!steps Create a Sponsor Account

Generate a separate keypair for the sponsor who will pay transaction fees. The
sponsor needs SOL for fees but doesn't need to hold the tokens being
transferred.

```ts !! title="Sponsor Transaction Fee"
const sponsor = (await generateKeypair()).signer;
```

## !!steps Create Transfer Instruction

Create the token transfer instruction with the sender as authority. The sender
owns the tokens and must sign the transfer.

```ts !! title="Sponsor Transaction Fee"
const sponsor = (await generateKeypair()).signer;

// !focus(1:6)
const transferInstruction = getTransferInstruction({
  source: senderAta,
  destination: recipientAta,
  authority: sender, // Sender signs for the transfer
  amount: 250_000n // adjusted for the mint's decimals
});
```

## !!steps Send with Sponsor as Fee Payer

Use `prepareAndSend` with both `authority` (the sender who signs the transfer)
and `feePayer` (the sponsor who pays fees). Both must sign the transaction.

```ts !! title="Sponsor Transaction Fee"
const sponsor = (await generateKeypair()).signer;

const transferInstruction = getTransferInstruction({
  source: senderAta,
  destination: recipientAta,
  authority: sender,
  amount: 250_000n
});

// !focus(1:6)
const signature = await client.transaction.prepareAndSend({
  authority: sender, // Signs the transfer instruction
  // !mark
  feePayer: sponsor, // Pays the transaction fees
  instructions: [transferInstruction],
  version: 0
});
```

## Gasless at Scale with Kora

The fee payer primitive is powerful, but building a production gasless system requires more: managing sponsor wallets, handling token conversions (so users can "pay" fees in USDC), rate limiting, and security controls.

[Kora](https://launch.solana.com/products/kora) handles this complexity. It's a JSON-RPC server that provides fee abstraction so users never need SOL. You can fully sponsor fees or accept fee payment in any token.

Deploy Kora with a single command:

```bash
cargo install kora-cli
kora --config path/to/kora.toml rpc start --signers-config path/to/signers.toml
```

Then use the Kora client to sign and send transactions:

```bash
pnpm add @solana/kora
```

```typescript
import { KoraClient } from "@solana/kora";

const kora = new KoraClient({ rpcUrl: "https://your-kora-instance" });

const { signature } = await kora.signAndSendTransaction({
  transaction: base64EncodedTransaction
});
```
