  Process payments at scale with gasless transactions and fee abstraction
---

Processing payments at scale—payroll, merchant payouts, loyalty rewards—requires
more than sending individual transfers.

To process many payments efficiently:

1. **Batch instructions** into single transactions to reduce fees and latency
2. **Batch transactions** to parallelize throughput across the network
3. **Fee abstraction** so users never need to hold SOL
