description: Process payments at scale with gasless transactions and fee abstraction
---

Processing payments at scale—payroll, merchant payouts, loyalty rewards—requires more than sending individual transfers.

To process many payments efficiently:

1. **Batch instructions** into single transactions to reduce fees and latency
2. **Batch transactions** to parallelize throughput across the network
3. **Sponsor gas fees** so users never need to hold SOL ([See Fee Sponsorship](/docs/payments/send-payments/sponsor-transaction-fee))
