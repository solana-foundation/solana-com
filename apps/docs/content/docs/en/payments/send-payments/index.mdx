Whether you're building payroll disbursements, vendor payouts, or cross-border
remittances, sending payments on Solana means sub-second settlement, sub-cent
fees, and no intermediaries taking a cut. Attach memos for reconciliation, batch
hundreds of payments into a single transaction, or sponsor fees so your users
never need to hold SOL.

This section covers the core patterns for moving stablecoins—from single
transfers to high-volume payment processing.
