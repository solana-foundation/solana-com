Solana is built with certain features that are ideal for payments including
native fee abstraction, sub-cent fees, embedded memos, predictably stable fees,
and fast confirmation times. In 2025, Solana processed over
[**$1 trillion**](https://app.artemisanalytics.com/asset/solana?from=assets) in
stablecoin volume. This guide will help you build advanced payment systems for
multiple use cases including remittances, treasury optimization, global payouts,
cross-border payments, merchant acceptance, invoices, and more.

## Why Solana

- **Instant settlement**. Funds secured in ~400ms. No T+2, no manual batch
  processing, no reconciliation delays.
- **Sub-cent fees**. Median fee ~$0.001 per transaction. Batch multiple payments
  into a single transaction to improve payment efficiency and reduce costs
  further.
- **Local fee markets.** Dedicated fee markets for payments so your flows are
  unaffected by other network activity.
- **Parallel execution**. Process transactions in parallel to further increase
  your payment throughput.
- **Familiar UX**. Sponsor or abstract away network fees so users pay in
  stablecoins without acquiring SOL.
- **Programmable**. Build custom payment applications with compliance built in
  (reconciliation memos, blacklists, automated tax accounting, etc.).
