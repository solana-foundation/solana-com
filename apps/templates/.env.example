# Main Site URL Configuration
# This should be set to the base URL of the main solana.com site when deploying
# the templates app to a subdomain (templates.solana.com).
#
# - Production: https://solana.com
# - Preview/Staging: https://preview.solana.com (or your preview URL)
# - Local Development: http://localhost:3000 (if main site runs on 3000)
# - Leave empty or unset if this IS the main site
#
# This ensures header links navigate back to the main site from the subdomain.
