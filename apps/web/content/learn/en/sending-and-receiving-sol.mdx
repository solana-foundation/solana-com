# Sending and Receiving SOL

Being able to send and receive SOL is your first practical skill on Solana. SOL
is the native token of the Solana network, used for transactions, staking, and
interacting with applications. In this chapter, you'll learn how transfers work
and practice making your first transaction.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- Understand your wallet address and how to share it safely
- Send SOL to another wallet
- Receive SOL from others
- Check transaction status
- Understand what happens during a transfer

## Understanding Your Wallet Address

Your wallet address is like your account number on Solana. It's:

- **Public**: Safe to share when receiving funds
- **Unique**: No two wallets have the same address
- **Permanent**: Doesn't change or expire

Example address: `7xKXtg2CW87d8V6zXKBq7cM8Y2FPHwzaAkxqEqD7x4rH`

### Sharing Your Address

You can share your address through:

- **Copy/Paste**: Click the copy button in your wallet
- **QR Code**: Let others scan it with their phone
- **ENS/Domain Names**: Human-readable names (like `yourname.sol`)

## Receiving SOL

Receiving SOL is straightforward:

1. **Open your wallet**
2. **Find your address** (usually displayed at the top)
3. **Share it** with the sender
4. **Wait a few seconds** for the transaction to complete
5. **See your new balance** update automatically

### What Senders Need

When someone sends you SOL, they only need:

- Your wallet address
- The amount to send

They don't need your name, location, or any personal information.

## Sending SOL

Here's how to send SOL to someone else:

### Step 1: Get the Recipient's Address

- Ask them to share their Solana wallet address
- Double-check you have the correct address
- Remember: transactions cannot be reversed

### Step 2: Initiate the Transfer

1. Click "Send" in your wallet
2. Paste the recipient's address
3. Enter the amount of SOL
4. Review the transaction fee (usually < $0.001)

### Step 3: Confirm and Send

1. Review all details carefully
2. Confirm the transaction
3. Wait 1-2 seconds for completion
4. Save the transaction ID for your records

## Understanding Transaction Details

Every transaction creates a record containing:

- **Signature**: Unique transaction identifier
- **From/To**: Sender and recipient addresses
- **Amount**: How much SOL was transferred
- **Fee**: Network fee paid (in SOL)
- **Timestamp**: When it occurred
- **Status**: Success or failure

You can view any transaction on a block explorer like Solscan or Solana
Explorer.

## Common Questions

### How long do transfers take?

Typically 1-2 seconds. Solana processes transactions very quickly compared to
traditional banking.

### What if I send to the wrong address?

Transactions are permanent and cannot be reversed. Always double-check addresses
before sending.

### Why do I need SOL for fees?

Every transaction requires a small fee (usually $0.00025) to compensate the
network validators who process it.

### Can I send other tokens besides SOL?

Yes, but you'll always need a small amount of SOL for transaction fees, even
when sending other tokens.

## Practice Exercise

Ready to try your first transaction? Here's a safe way to practice:

1. **Send a tiny amount** (like 0.001 SOL) to a friend
2. **Have them send it back** to you
3. **Look up the transaction** on a block explorer
4. **Note the fee** and confirmation time

This helps you get comfortable with the process using minimal amounts.

## Transaction Best Practices

- **Start small** when sending to a new address
- **Save important addresses** in your wallet's address book
- **Keep transaction records** for tax or personal tracking
- **Double-check addresses** - especially the first and last 4 characters
- **Be aware of the current SOL price** when sending

## What's Next

Now that you can send and receive SOL, you're ready to explore more advanced
features. In the next chapter, we'll learn about staking - a way to earn rewards
by helping secure the Solana network.

Remember: every expert was once a beginner. Take your time, start with small
amounts, and build confidence through practice.
