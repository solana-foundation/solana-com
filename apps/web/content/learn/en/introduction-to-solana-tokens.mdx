# Introduction to Solana Tokens

Tokens are digital assets built on Solana. Like how the US dollar is the native
currency of the United States, SOL is Solana's native currency. Tokens represent
all other assets - from stablecoins like USDC to project tokens and NFTs. This
chapter explains how tokens work and what you can do with them.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:

- What tokens are and how they work on Solana
- Different types of tokens and their uses
- How to manage tokens in your wallet
- Token accounts and fees
- Safety considerations when dealing with tokens

## Understanding Tokens on Solana

Solana has two main types of digital assets:

- **SOL**: The native currency used for transactions and fees
- **Tokens**: All other digital assets on Solana

Just like apps on your phone follow certain standards to work properly, tokens
on Solana follow a common standard that makes them compatible with wallets and
applications.

## Types of Tokens

### Stablecoins

Digital versions of traditional currencies that maintain stable value.

**Examples:**

- **USDC**: Digital US dollars
- **USDT**: Tether, another USD stablecoin
- **EURC**: Digital euros

**Uses:** Saving, payments, trading, avoiding volatility

### Wrapped Assets

Tokens representing assets from other networks.

**Examples:**

- **Wrapped Bitcoin (BTC)**: Bitcoin usable on Solana
- **Wrapped Ethereum (ETH)**: Ethereum on Solana
- **Wrapped SOL**: Used in some DeFi protocols

**Uses:** Access other cryptocurrencies with Solana's speed and low fees

### Project Tokens

Tokens created by applications and protocols.

**Examples:**

- Governance tokens for voting on protocol decisions
- Exchange tokens offering fee discounts
- Protocol tokens for ecosystem participation

**Uses:** Governance voting, fee discounts, rewards

### Utility Tokens

Tokens with specific functions within applications.

**Examples:**

- Gaming tokens for in-game economies
- Social tokens for creator communities
- Reward tokens from protocols

**Uses:** Access features, earn rewards, participate in ecosystems

## How Token Accounts Work

Unlike some networks where all assets share one address, Solana uses a token
account system:

1. **Main Wallet**: Holds your SOL
2. **Token Accounts**: Separate accounts for each token type

### Why Token Accounts?

- Better performance and organization
- Clear separation of different assets
- Efficient network storage

### Account Rent

- Each token account requires ~0.002 SOL deposit
- This "rent" is refundable when closing the account
- Prevents spam and funds network storage
- Typically costs $0.20-0.50 per token type

## Managing Your Tokens

### Receiving Tokens

1. Share your wallet address
2. Sender initiates transfer
3. Wallet creates token account if needed
4. Tokens appear in your wallet

### Viewing Your Tokens

Modern wallets show:

- Token symbols and logos
- Current balances
- USD values
- Recent transactions

### Sending Tokens

1. Select token to send
2. Enter recipient address
3. Choose amount
4. Confirm transaction
5. Pay small SOL fee (~$0.0005)

### Closing Token Accounts

When you no longer need a token:

1. Send all tokens out
2. Close the account
3. Recover the rent deposit

## Token Creation Basics

Anyone can create tokens on Solana:

### Requirements

- Small amount of SOL for fees (~0.5 SOL)
- Basic token information (name, symbol, supply)
- Optional: logo and metadata

### Common Uses

- Community tokens
- Reward systems
- Fundraising
- Gaming economies
- Experimental projects

### Important Note

Creating a token doesn't give it value. Value comes from utility, adoption, and
market dynamics.

## Token Safety

### Verify Before Trusting

- Check official project websites
- Verify token addresses
- Look for audit reports
- Research the team

### Common Scams to Avoid

- **Fake tokens**: Impersonating popular projects
- **Rug pulls**: Creators abandoning projects
- **Honeypots**: Tokens you can buy but not sell
- **Pump and dumps**: Artificial price manipulation

### Best Practices

1. **Research thoroughly** before buying
2. **Start small** with new tokens
3. **Use reputable sources** for token information
4. **Be skeptical** of guaranteed returns
5. **Check liquidity** before large purchases

## Working with Tokens

### Swapping Tokens

Use DEX aggregators to find the best rates:

1. Connect wallet
2. Select tokens to swap
3. Review rate and fees
4. Confirm swap

### Checking Token Info

Resources for research:

- Block explorers: View token details and holders
- Price aggregators: Check prices and liquidity
- Official project sites: Verify authenticity

### Managing Multiple Tokens

- Organize by hiding zero balances
- Favorite frequently used tokens
- Use portfolio trackers
- Close unused token accounts

## Common Questions

### Do I need SOL to send tokens?

Yes, all transactions require small SOL fees, even when sending other tokens.

### Why do some tokens appear automatically?

Projects can airdrop tokens to wallets. Be cautious of unsolicited tokens.

### Can I recover sent tokens?

No, transactions on Solana are permanent. Always double-check addresses.

### What determines token value?

Supply and demand, utility, project development, and market sentiment all affect
token prices.

## What's Next

Now that you understand tokens, you're ready to learn about NFTs - unique
digital assets that represent ownership of specific items rather than fungible
currencies. The next chapter explores how NFTs work and their various use cases.

Remember: tokens are tools that enable new types of digital economies. Focus on
understanding their utility rather than speculation, and always research before
investing.
