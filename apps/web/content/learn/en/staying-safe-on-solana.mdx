to avoiding common scams.

## The Golden Rule: Your Seed Phrase

Your seed phrase is the most important thing to protect. It's a set of 12-24
words that can restore your wallet on any device. Think of it as a master key
that:

- Can never be changed
- Gives complete access to your wallet
- Should never be shared with anyone

### Protecting Your Seed Phrase

**DO:**

- Write it on paper (never type it)
- Store in a secure location
- Consider multiple copies in different places
- Use a fireproof safe if possible

**DON'T:**

- Screenshot or photograph it
- Store in email or cloud services
- Share it with anyone (no exceptions)
- Enter it on websites

## Common Scams to Avoid

### Fake Support

Scammers often pretend to be support staff:

- Real support never DMs first
- They never ask for your seed phrase
- Always verify through official channels
- Be suspicious of unsolicited help

### Phishing Websites

Fake sites that steal your information:

- Always check the URL carefully
- Look for subtle misspellings
- Bookmark real sites
- Use official links only

### "Free Money" Scams

If it sounds too good to be true, it is:

- No legitimate airdrops require seed phrases
- Be skeptical of guaranteed returns
- Research before participating
- Start with tiny amounts when trying new things

### Wallet Drainers

Malicious apps that empty wallets:

- Only connect to verified applications
- Review transaction requests carefully
- Disconnect wallet when done
- Use separate wallets for different activities

## Transaction Safety

Before approving any transaction:

1. **Check the recipient address**
   - Verify first and last characters
   - Send test amounts for large transfers
   - Save frequently used addresses

2. **Understand what you're signing**
   - Read transaction details
   - Look for unusual permissions
   - If confused, don't approve

3. **Verify the source**
   - Make sure you initiated the action
   - Check you're on the correct website
   - Be extra careful with new apps

## Security Tools

### Hot Wallets (Browser/Mobile)

**Best for:** Daily use, small amounts

- Convenient for regular transactions

### Hardware Wallets

Without your seed phrase, wallet recovery is impossible. This is why secure
backups are critical.

No. All Solana transactions are permanent. Always double-check before
confirming.

### Is it safe to share my wallet address?

Yes, your public wallet address is safe to share for receiving funds. Never
share your seed phrase.

Check official websites, verified social accounts, audit reports, and community
reputation.
