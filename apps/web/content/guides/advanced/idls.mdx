IDL stands for **Interface Definition Language**.  
On Solana, IDLs are JSON files that describe the interface of a program. They
allow explorers and users to decode program instructions, account data and
program errors and offer the possibility to generate clients for in different
program languages.

---

## Why IDLs Matter

- **Standardization** → A shared format for program interfaces.
- **Developer Experience** → Generate client SDKs automatically.
- **Composability** → Other developers can interact with your program without
  reading its source code.
- **Readybility** → Everyone can read program instructions and account data in
  explorers without reading the programs source code..

## What you can do with IDLs

### Decoding Instruction and Account Data

All Explorers use program IDLs to decode instructions and account data. Here you
can see a
[Anchor 30.1](https://explorer.solana.com/address/MkabCfyUD6rBTaYHpgKBBpBo5qzWA2pK2hrGGKMurJt/idl)
and a
[Legacy IDL](https://explorer.solana.com/address/2o48ieM95rmHqMWC5B3tTX4DL7cLm4m1Kuwjay3keQSv/idl)
example in the Solana Explorer UI. In
[this transaction](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3U81bTLnaJr3vZRx6LRovP8WJ2d4afiysFkjXijiPsZaHejFMuhHVXd8bPpAGckUwoqqq1te1LMvqQwCCjYobgm4)
you can for example see the decoded instruction data for a 2048 game and you can
clearly see the Push In Direction instruction with a clear name and the
Direction.

You can decode instructions and account data in your typescript client by using
the
[Solana JS helpers](https://github.com/solana-developers/helpers?tab=readme-ov-file#parse-account-data).

### Parsing Anchor Events or Account changes

You can easily subscribe to account changes in your program by using the
generated TypeScript types.

```ts
// Fetch account once
const account = await program.account.counter.fetch(counterPda);

// Subscrive via websocket to account changes
program.account.myAccount.subscribe(counterPda).on("change", (account) => {
  console.log("Account changed:", account);
});

// Or use decoder to decode any account or instruction data
connection.onAccountChange(counterPda, (account) => {
  console.log(
    "Account changed:",
    program.coder.accounts.decode("counterData", account.data)
  );
});
```

You can for example emit Anchor events in your program and then log these
events, write them in a database or use them to for example send a message into
a telegram chat.

```Rust
// Emit the purchase event
emit!(PurchaseMade {
    buyer: *ctx.accounts.signer.key,
    product_name: name,
    price,
    timestamp: Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp,
    table_number,
    receipt_id,
    telegram_channel_id: ctx.accounts.receipts.telegram_channel_id.clone(),
    store_name: ctx.accounts.receipts.store_name.clone(),
    receipts_account: ctx.accounts.receipts.key(),
});
```

For that you can use the
[Solana JS helpers](https://github.com/solana-developers/helpers?tab=readme-ov-file#parse-transaction-events)
to parse the events. Here is an
[example implementation](https://github.com/Woody4618/bar/blob/main/app/pages/api/webhooktg.ts#L61)
that uses anchor events to post messages into a telegram chat.

### Decode Transactions

You can also decode transactions in your client by using the
[Solana JS helpers](https://github.com/solana-developers/helpers?tab=readme-ov-file#decode-anchor-transaction).
This will give you a typed object of the whole transaction.

### Build your own client

Using an IDL you can create your own client in many languages. You just find a
program you want to interact with, download the IDL and then you can generate a
client in your preferred language.

Here is an [example](#typescript-client) of how to generate a client in
TypeScript.

## IDLs in Anchor

If you’re using the [Anchor framework](https://www.anchor-lang.com/):

- The IDL is auto-generated when you build your program.
- It lives in `target/idl/<program>.json`.
- TypeScript types are generated in `target/types/<program>.ts`.
- The program address is stored in the IDL (`idl.address`).

```bash
anchor build
cat target/idl/counter.json
```

## Anatomy of an IDL

Here’s a minimal example (Anchor v0.30+ spec):

```json
{
  "address": "6khKp4BeJpCjBY1Eh39ybiqbfRnrn2UzWeUARjQLXYRC",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "counter",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "spec": "0.1.0"
  },
  "instructions": [
    {
      "name": "increment",
      "discriminator": [11, 18, 104, 9, 104, 174, 59, 33],
      "accounts": [{ "name": "counter", "writable": true }],
      "args": []
    }
  ],
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "Counter",
      "discriminator": [255, 176, 4, 245, 188, 253, 124, 25]
    }
  ],
  "types": [
    {
      "name": "Counter",
      "type": {
        "kind": "struct",
        "fields": [{ "name": "count", "type": "u64" }]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- **address**: the on-chain program ID.
- **metadata**: `{ name, version, spec, ... }` about the program/interface.
- **instructions**: callable methods with `accounts`, `args`, and a
  `discriminator`.
- **accounts**: account types exposed by the program (with discriminators).
- **types**: struct/enum/type aliases referenced by instructions/accounts.
- **events / errors / constants**: optional definitions for events, error codes,
  constants.

> Note: Anchor v0.30 introduced a new IDL spec. Legacy IDLs (pre-0.30) used
> fields like `name`, `version` at top level and `isMut`/`isSigner` in accounts.
> You can convert legacy IDLs using `anchor idl convert` or rebuild with Anchor
> v0.30+. If you need to convert a legacy IDL to the new spec on the fly you can
> also use this
> [conversion code](https://github.com/solana-developers/helpers/blob/main/src/lib/convertLegacyIdl.ts).
> This is useful for example if you maintain a solana explorer and want to stay
> backwards compatible.

### TypeScript Client

Anchor will also automatically generate a TypeScript client for you. You can
find the generated client in the `target/types` folder.

Then in your client (TypeScript, v0.30+) you can call program instructions and
fetch accounts as easy as this:

```ts
import { AnchorProvider, Program } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import idl from "./counter.json";

const provider = AnchorProvider.local();
const program = new Program(idl, provider);
await program.methods.increment().rpc();
```

### C# Client

To generate a C# client you can use the following command:

```bash
cd program
dotnet tool install Solana.Unity.Anchor.Tool <- run once
dotnet anchorgen -i target/idl/counter.json -o target/idl/Counter.cs
```

You can read more about how to interact with a C# client from Unity in the
[Solana games preset](https://github.com/solana-developers/solana-game-preset)
or in the
[Games docs](https://solana.com/de/developers/guides/games/porting-anchor-to-unity#generating-the-client).

### Python Client

For Python you can use the [AnchorPy](https://github.com/kevinheavey/anchorpy)
library.

More client generators will be available using Codama renderers in the future.

## IDLs Without Anchor

Not all programs are built with Anchor.  
For native Solana programs:

- A tool called **[Codama](https://github.com/codama-idl/codama)** is currently
  in development to generate IDLs from Rust via macros or by converting Anchor
  IDLs. Here is an in progress example of
  [Codama Macros](https://github.com/lorisleiva/codama-demo-2025-08/tree/main/3-from-macros)
  to generate a Codama IDL. You can also generate an Anchor IDL from a Codama
  IDL making it a superset.
- Until the codama macros are completely ready you can also use
  [Metaplex Shank](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/shank) to generate a
  Codama IDL.
- You can also **write the IDL by hand** (Anchor or Codama formats) but this is
  not very reliable. Ai tools like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) can help
  you to write the IDL but you should always verify the IDL with the program
  source code and the better way is to use Anchor, Codama or Metaplex Shank.

## Storing IDLs On-Chain

There are two ways to upload IDLs on-chain. The most used and standard one is
the Anchor IDL account. How Anchor allows you to upload your IDLs on-chain is by
adding additional instructions to your program allow you to upload and update
your IDLs on-chain. This adds some extra size to the program and this is why the
program metadata program was created. In the program metadata program all the
program IDLs and security.txt info like name, contact and icon are stored in
PDAs of the
[program metadata program](https://github.com/solana-program/program-metadata).

### Anchor IDL Account

Anchor saved IDLs on-chain in a PDA of your program.

- IDLs can be uploaded **on-chain** to the Anchor IDL account.
- This allows explorers, wallets, and SDKs to fetch the IDL directly from
  Solana.

First time (initialize the IDL account):

```bash
anchor idl init <PROGRAM_ID> -f target/idl/counter.json --provider.cluster devnet
```

Upgrades (subsequent updates by the authority):

```bash
anchor idl upgrade <PROGRAM_ID> -f target/idl/counter.json --provider.cluster devnet
```

Useful related commands:

```bash
anchor idl fetch -o idl.json <PROGRAM_ID>
anchor idl authority <PROGRAM_ID>
anchor idl set-authority -p <PROGRAM_ID> -n <NEW_AUTHORITY>
anchor idl erase-authority -p <PROGRAM_ID>
```

Note that by default the Anchor IDL account generation is permission less. So
upload your IDL as soon as possible and then set an authority.

You can read more about the Anchor IDL account in the
[Anchor docs](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/basics/idl).

### Program Metadata Program (PMP)

The program metadata program is a program that allows you to store the program
IDLs and security.txt info like name, contact and icon on-chain. This will
probably be the standard way to store IDLs on-chain in the future.

```bash
npx @solana-program/program-metadata write idl <program-id> ./idl.json
```

You can read more about the program metadata program in the
[program metadata program docs](https://github.com/solana-program/program-metadata).

Note: As of the last update of the article the PMP is not supported by all
explorers yet.

## Best Practices

The best practise for program deploys is to use a Multisig like
[Squads](https://squads.so/) and to make this process as easy as possible you
use the
[Solana GitHub Actions workflows](https://github.com/solana-developers/github-workflows).

Like this the program will automatically be upgraded, IDL uploaded, the build
verified and then there will be a transaction proposed for your multisig to sign
and deploy the program.

1. **Keep IDLs updated** → Always update the IDL when you make changes to your
   program.
2. **Upload IDLs on-chain** → for transparency and tooling support.
3. **Document custom errors** → improves UX for clients.
4. **Verify builds** → ensure the IDL matches the deployed program.

## Versioning IDLs

Currently with Anchor your can only have one version of the IDL on chain at a
time. This means that if you want to make changes to your program you need to
upload a new version of the IDL, preferably at the same time as you upgrade the
program. This can lead to problems if the clients are not updated yet and is one
reason why the program metadata program was written. The PMP you will be able to
have different seeds for your program and do versioning like that. The design
for that is not completely final yet and open for discussion.

  auto-generates IDLs and clients. (TypeScript, C#, Python)
- [Codama](https://github.com/codama-idl/codama) → IDL tooling + client
  generators (Rust, JS/TS, Umi/Kit, etc.).
- **[Program Metadata Program](https://github.com/solana-program/program-metadata)**
  → store IDLs and security.txt information on-chain.

That’s the basics of IDLs on Solana. They’re the **bridge between on-chain
programs and off-chain clients**, enabling the rich ecosystem of tools and SDKs
you see today.
