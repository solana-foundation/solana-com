A vanity public key is a Solana address that begins with specific characters you
choose. The more characters you want at the beginning of your vanity address,
the longer it will take to generate one.

You can create a vanity address using the
[Solana CLI](/docs/intro/installation):

```terminal
$ solana-keygen grind --starts-with hi:1
```
