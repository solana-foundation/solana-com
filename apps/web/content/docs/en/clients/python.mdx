## Solana Python SDK
There are two packages that are useful for developing with Python:

[`@kevinheavy/solana.py`](https://github.com/michaelhly/solana-py)
- Solana.py is the base Python library for interacting with Solana.
- You can use it to build transactions and interact with the [Solana JSON RPC API](/docs/rpc), much like you would do with [solana-web3.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/)

- It also covers the [SPL Token Program](https://spl.solana.com/token).

- [Latest Documentation](https://michaelhly.github.io/solana-py/).

[`@kevinheavey/solders`](https://github.com/kevinheavey/solders)
- `solders` is a high-performance Python toolkit for Solana, written in Rust. It provides robust solutions in the following areas:

- Core SDK functionality: keypairs, pubkeys, signing and serializing transactions.
- RPC: building requests and parsing responses (for networking and asynchronous APIs, 
[solana-py](https://michaelhly.github.io/solana-py/rpc/async_api/) is the recommended option).
- Integration testing: the `solders.litesvm` module is an alternative to `solana-test-validator` that's much more convenient and **much** faster. It's based on [solana-program-test](https://crates.io/crates/solana-program-test).


## Solana Client Python SDK

If you want to interact with Solana contracts with Python, you can use clients SDK to render Solana rust contracts to Python clients, if only you can get the IDL file of the contract. 

[`Codama-py`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/codama-py)
- Standardize any Solana on-chain contract program to [`Codama IDL`](https://github.com/codama-idl/codama) and generate an interactive Python client. 
- Supports both Anchor and custom programs.

[`Anchor-py`](https://github.com/kevinheavey/anchorpy)
- Anchor-py is a Python client for Anchor programs. It can generate clients from Anchor IDL files, and interact with Anchor programs.
