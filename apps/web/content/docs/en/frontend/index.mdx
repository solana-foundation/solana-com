Frontend development on Solana involves working with Programs, wallets and
popular JavaScript frameworks like React. Interacting with these components
requires handling connection, transaction creation and reading from Solana
Accounts.

To help with this work, a variety Solana Client libraries are available in different frameworks.

## Main libraries
