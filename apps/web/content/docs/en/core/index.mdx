To build on Solana, it's essential to understand several key concepts unique to
Solana development. This section covers the core concepts you need to understand
as you start building on Solana, including accounts, transactions, programs, and
more.

## Solana Account Model

On Solana, all data is stored in what are referred to as "accounts‚Äù. The way
data is organized on the Solana blockchain resembles a key-value store, where
each entry in the database is called an "account".

Learn more about [Accounts](/docs/core/accounts) here.

## Transactions and Instructions

On Solana, we send transactions to interact with the network. Transactions
include one or more instructions, each representing a specific operation to be
processed. The execution logic for instructions is stored on programs deployed
to the Solana network, where each program defines its own set of instructions.

Learn more about [Transactions](/docs/core/transactions) and
[Instructions](/docs/core/transactions#instruction) here.

## Fees on Solana

The Solana blockchain has a few different types of fees and costs that are
incurred to use the network. These can be segmented into a few specific types:

- Transaction Fees - A fee to have validators process transactions/instructions
- Prioritization Fees - An optional fee to boost transactions processing order
- Rent - A withheld balance to keep data stored on-chain

Learn more about [Fees on Solana](/docs/core/fees) here.

## Programs on Solana

On Solana, "smart contracts" are called programs. Each program is stored in an
on-chain account and contains executable code that defines specific
instructions. These instructions represent the program's functionality and can
be invoked by sending transactions to the network.

Learn more about [Programs on Solana](/docs/core/programs) here.

## Program Derived Address

Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) provide developers on Solana with two main use
cases:

- **Deterministic Account Addresses**: PDAs provide a mechanism to
  deterministically derive an address using a combination of optional "seeds"
  (predefined inputs) and a specific program ID.
- **Enable Program Signing**: The Solana runtime enables programs to "sign" for
  PDAs which are derived from its program ID.

You can think of PDAs as a way to create hashmap-like structures on-chain from a
predefined set of inputs (e.g. strings, numbers, and other account addresses).

Learn more about [Program Derived Address](/docs/core/pda) here.

## Cross Program Invocation

A Cross Program Invocation (CPI) refers to when one program invokes the
instructions of another program. This mechanism allows for the composability of
Solana programs.

You can think of instructions as API endpoints that a program exposes to the
network and a CPI as one API internally invoking another API.

Learn more about [Cross Program Invocation](/docs/core/cpi) here.

## Tokens on Solana

Tokens are digital assets that represent ownership over diverse categories of
assets. Tokenization enables the digitalization of property rights, serving as a
fundamental component for managing both fungible and non-fungible assets.

- Fungible Tokens represent interchangeable and divisible assets of the same
  type and value (ex. USDC).
- Non-fungible Tokens (NFT) represent ownership of indivisible assets (e.g.
  artwork).

## Clusters and Endpoints

The Solana blockchain has several different groups of validators, known as
[Clusters](/docs/references/clusters). Each serving a different purposes and
containing dedicated nodes to fulfill [JSON-RPC](/docs/rpc/) requests.

There are three primary clusters on the Solana network, with the following
public endpoints:

- Mainnet - `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com` (production)
- Devnet - `https://api.devnet.solana.com` (developer experimentation)
- Testnet - `https://api.testnet.solana.com` (validator testing)
