## How to implement pausable tokens

The pausable extension is a mint extension that allows token creators to configure tokens that can be globally paused and unpaused by a designated pause authority. When paused, all token operations including transfers, minting, and burning are temporarily disabled across all token accounts for that mint. This extension is ideal for use cases such as emergency stops, regulatory compliance, maintenance periods, or situations requiring temporary suspension of token activity. The pause authority can resume normal token operations at any time by unpausing the mint. This extension can be enabled using the [`PausableExtension`](https://github.com/solana-program/token-2022/blob/6f2473344d70271f632c3e9b7e945be00186c536/interface/src/instruction.rs#L733)

<Callout type="info">
