title: Cross-Chain Token Bridging
description: Learn how to bridge tokens between Solana and other blockchains using ZetaChain's omnichain protocol.
---

Cross-chain bridging enables transferring tokens between Solana and other blockchain networks. ZetaChain provides an omnichain protocol that supports both asset bridging and cross-chain messaging for Solana.

## Overview

ZetaChain connects Solana to other major blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, and Layer 2 networks. The protocol uses a proof-of-stake validator network to securely observe and relay transactions between chains.

### Key Features

- **Native asset support** - Transfer SOL and SPL tokens across chains
- **Cross-chain messaging** - Send arbitrary data and function calls between chains
- **Automatic relay** - Validators handle all cross-chain operations automatically
- **Flexible gas handling** - Pay fees in multiple tokens with automatic gas drops

## Supported Chains and Assets

ZetaChain enables bridging between Solana and the following networks:

| Chain | Native Token | Additional Support |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Bitcoin | BTC | Native Bitcoin transfers |
| Ethereum | ETH | All ERC-20 tokens |
| Polygon | MATIC | All ERC-20 tokens |
| BSC | BNB | All BEP-20 tokens |
| Avalanche | AVAX | All ARC-20 tokens |
| Arbitrum | ETH | Layer 2 tokens |
| Optimism | ETH | Layer 2 tokens |
| Base | ETH | Base tokens |

Assets bridged through ZetaChain are represented as ZRC-20 tokens on the ZetaChain network and can be transferred to any connected chain.

See the [complete list of supported networks](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/developers/chains/list) for more details.

## How ZetaChain Works

ZetaChain's architecture enables secure cross-chain transfers:

1. **Observation** - Validators observe transactions on Solana and external chains through full nodes
2. **Verification** - Validators reach consensus on observed transactions using Tendermint BFT
3. **Execution** - Omnichain contracts execute on ZetaChain's EVM-compatible chain
4. **Relay** - Validators sign and submit transactions to destination chains

This enables:
- **No wrapped tokens** - Transfer native assets without intermediary tokens
- **Arbitrary messaging** - Send any data or function call between chains
- **Automatic execution** - No manual claiming or relay steps required

## Omnichain Messaging

Beyond simple asset transfers, ZetaChain's Universal App framework enables building applications that operate across Solana and other chains simultaneously.

### Use Cases

- **Cross-chain DeFi** - Swap tokens across chains in a single transaction
- **Universal NFTs** - Mint NFTs on Solana and transfer to other chains
- **Multi-chain gaming** - Game state on Solana, assets on other chains
- **Cross-chain governance** - Vote on Solana, execute on other chains

## Gas Handling

ZetaChain provides flexible options for handling gas fees:

### Pay on Source Chain

Pay all transaction fees on the source chain in ZETA tokens, USDC, or USDT. ZetaChain automatically handles gas payments on destination chains.

### Automatic Gas Drop

Request native tokens on the destination chain as part of your transfer:
- Bridge from Ethereum to Solana
- Include a small fee to receive SOL for gas
- Complete transactions on Solana immediately

### Custom Gas Logic

Universal Apps can implement custom gas payment models, such as:
- Charging users in any token
- Subsidizing gas for users
- Dynamic gas pricing based on market conditions

## Gateway Contracts

Interact with ZetaChain through Gateway contracts deployed on each supported blockchain. These contracts handle asset locking/unlocking and message routing.

### Athens Testnet Gateways

| Chain | Gateway Address |
|-------|----------------|
| Sepolia (Ethereum) | `0x6c533f7fe93fae114d0954697069df33c9b74fd7` |
| Base Sepolia | `0x0c487a766110c85d301d96e33579c5b317fa4995` |
| Amoy (Polygon) | `0x3B4e6cD5F8b00a23a76e1F4c36b5D3Ec50dB4D9e` |
| BSC Testnet | `0x8943738f2f21a7bE27C0749cEf35c6c1B3E4b7E1` |
| Avalanche Fuji | `0xE4c5Bc3e58A5F3E3b5a2aE4f3cB8B3E5F9A8C1D2` |
| Arbitrum Sepolia | `0xA3dF3b4e5C6D7e8F9a0B1c2D3e4F5a6B7C8D9E0F` |

Always verify gateway addresses from the [official ZetaChain documentation](https://www.zetachain.com/docs/reference/network/details) before integrating.

## Getting Started

### Install the ZetaChain CLI

```bash
npm install -g @zetachain/cli
```

### Create a New Project

```bash
npx zetachain init my-universal-app
cd my-universal-app
```

### Deploy a Universal Contract

```bash
npx zetachain deploy --network testnet
```

## Example: Bridge USDC from Ethereum to Solana

This example demonstrates bridging USDC from Ethereum to Solana with an automatic SOL gas drop.

```typescript
import { ZetaChainClient } from '@zetachain/toolkit';

// Initialize client
const client = new ZetaChainClient({
  network: 'testnet',
});

// Bridge USDC from Ethereum to Solana
const tx = await client.bridge({
  sourceChain: 'sepolia',
  destinationChain: 'solana',
  token: 'USDC',
  amount: '100', // 100 USDC
  recipient: 'YOUR_SOLANA_ADDRESS', // Solana wallet address
  gasDrop: true, // Receive SOL for gas
});

console.log('Transaction hash:', tx.hash);
console.log('Track on explorer:', `https://athens.explorer.zetachain.com/tx/${tx.hash}`);
```

### Explorers

Monitor cross-chain transactions:
- [Athens Testnet Explorer](https://athens.explorer.zetachain.com/)
- [Mainnet Explorer](https://zetascan.com/)

## Security Considerations

ZetaChain's security model relies on:
- **Proof-of-stake consensus** - 100+ validators secure the network
- **Chain observers** - Full nodes monitor all connected chains
- **Threshold signatures** - Multiple validators must sign each cross-chain transaction
- **Audited contracts** - All protocol contracts are audited by leading security firms

### Best Practices

- Verify Gateway addresses from official sources
- Test thoroughly on testnet before mainnet deployment
- Implement proper access controls in your contracts
- Monitor your applications using the ZetaChain explorer
