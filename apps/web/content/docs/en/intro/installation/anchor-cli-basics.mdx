This section walks through some common Anchor CLI commands to get you started.
For more information on the Anchor CLI, see the
[Anchor documentation](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs).

<Steps>
<Step>

### Initialize Project

To create a new Anchor project, run the following command:

```terminal
$ anchor init <project-name>
```

For example, to create a project called `my-project`, run:

```terminal
$ anchor init my-project
```

This command creates a new directory with the project name and initializes a new
Anchor project with a basic Rust program and TypeScript test template.

Navigate to the project directory:

```terminal
$ cd <project-name>
```

See the Anchor project's
[file structure](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/quickstart/local#project-file-structure).

</Step>

<Step>
### Build Program

To build your project, run the following command:

```terminal
$ anchor build
```

You can find the compiled program in the `/target/deploy` directory.

<Callout type="warn">

When running `anchor build`, if you encounter the following errors:

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="error: not a directory">

```
error: not a directory: '.../solana-release/bin/sdk/sbf/dependencies/platform-tools/rust/lib'
```

Try these solutions:

1. Force install using the following command:

```terminal
$ cargo build-sbf --force-tools-install
```

2. If the preceding solution doesn't work, clear the Solana cache:

```terminal
$ rm -rf ~/.cache/solana/*
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="lock file version 4 requires `-Znext-lockfile-bump">
You can fix this by changing the version field of `Cargo.lock` file from 4 to 3:

```diff title="Cargo.lock"
-version = 4
+version = 3
```

See [this issue](https://github.com/solana-foundation/anchor/issues/3392) for
more information.

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

After applying the preceding solution, attempt to run _shell`anchor build`_
again.

</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

### Deploy Program

To deploy your project, run the following command:

```terminal
$ anchor deploy
```

This command deploys your program to the `cluster` specified in the
[`Anchor.toml`](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/references/anchor-toml) file.

</Step>
<Step>

### Test Program

To test your project, run the following command:

```terminal
$ anchor test
```

<Callout>

This command builds, deploys, and runs the tests for your project.

When using `localnet` as the `cluster` in `Anchor.toml`, Anchor automatically
starts a local validator, deploys your program, runs tests, and then stops the
validator.

</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">

When running _shell`anchor test`_ after creating a new Anchor project on Linux
or WSL, you may encounter the following errors if you don't have Node.js or Yarn
installed:

```
Permission denied (os error 13)
```

```
No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

</Callout>
