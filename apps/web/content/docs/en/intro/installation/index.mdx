A quick installation to set up your local Solana development environment with one command.
Install Rust, the Solana CLI, and Anchor Framework on Windows (WSL), Linux, and Mac.
(If preferred, you may [install each dependency individually](/docs/intro/installation/dependencies).)

## Prerequisites

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Windows">

To develop Solana programs on Windows you **must** use
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (WSL).
After installing WSL, all other dependencies will be installed through the Linux terminal.

To install WSL, run the following command in Windows PowerShell:

```terminal
$ wsl --install
```

The installation process will prompt you to create a default user account.

By default, WSL installs Ubuntu. You can open a Linux terminal by searching
"Ubuntu" in the Search bar.

![WSL Ubuntu](/assets/docs/intro/installation/wsl-ubuntu-search.png)

If your Ubuntu terminal looks like the image below, you may encounter an issue
where `ctrl + v` (paste keyboard shortcut) doesn't work in the terminal.

If you encounter this issue, open Windows Terminal by searching for "Terminal"
in the Search bar.

![Windows Terminal](/assets/docs/intro/installation/wsl-windows-terminal.png)

Next, close the Windows Terminal and reopen a Linux terminal by searching for
Ubuntu again. The terminal should now look like the image below, where
`ctrl + v` (paste keyboard shortcut) works.

If you use VS Code, the
[WSL extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial) enables
you to use WSL and VS Code together.

![WSL Setup in VS Code](/assets/docs/intro/installation/wsl-vscode.png)

You will see the following in the VS Code status bar:

Once you have WSL set up, you are ready to either:
- Complete the [quick installation](#installation) using the Ubuntu (Linux)
  terminal
- Install [Rust](/docs/intro/installation/dependencies#install-rust), the
  [Solana CLI](/docs/intro/installation/dependencies#install-solana-cli), and
  the [Anchor CLI](/docs/intro/installation/dependencies#install-anchor-cli)
  individually, as described below

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linux">

<Tabs items={[".deb", ".rpm"]}>
<Tab value=".deb" >
If on Debian or Debian-dervived alternatives like Ubuntu or Mint, follow the steps below:

1. Update the package lists to ensure all the packages are up-to-date:

```terminal
$ sudo apt-get update
```

2. Install the following dependencies:

```terminal
$ sudo apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    pkg-config \
    libudev-dev llvm libclang-dev \
    protobuf-compiler libssl-dev
```

<Callout>
If you encounter the following error when installing `protobuf-compiler`, make
sure you first run _shell`sudo apt-get update`

```
Package protobuf-compiler is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source
```
</Callout>



  </Tab>

    <Tab value=".rpm" >
    For RHEL derivatives like Fedora or Red Hat Linux, follow the following steps.

Update the package lists to get the newer versions of packages by running the
command.

```terminal
$ sudo dnf upgrade --refresh
```

Next, install the following dependencies:

```terminal
$ sudo dnf group install c-development development-tools \
&& sudo dnf install pkg-config openssl-devel
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Installation

1. Enter the following command into your terminal to install all the necessary dependencies:

```terminal
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://solana-install.solana.workers.dev | bash
```

A successful installation will return output like the following:

```
Installed Versions:
Rust: rustc 1.86.0 (05f9846f8 2025-03-31)
Solana CLI: solana-cli 2.2.12 (src:0315eb6a; feat:1522022101, client:Agave)
Anchor CLI: anchor-cli 0.31.1
Node.js: v23.11.0
Yarn: 1.22.1
```

2. Verify a successful installation by checking the version of each installed dependency.

```terminal
$ rustc --version && solana --version && anchor --version && node --version && yarn --version
```

<Callout>
If the quick installation command fails, please refer to the
[Install Dependencies](/docs/intro/installation/dependencies) section below for instructions to
install each dependency individually.
</Callout>

### Next steps

Once you have installed all the necessary dependencies, you are ready to review the [Solana CLI Basics](/docs/intro/installation/solana-cli-basics) and [Anchor CLI Basics](/docs/intro/installation/anchor-cli-basics).
