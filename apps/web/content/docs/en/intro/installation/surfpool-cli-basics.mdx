Surfpool is a local development tool that simplifies Solana development by
automatically loading programs and accounts from a cluster (mainnet, devnet).
Use the Surfpool CLI to start a local validator for testing your programs and
transactions.

Visit the [Surfpool documentation](https://docs.surfpool.run/) for more
information.

## Start a local validator

To start a local validator, run the following command:

```terminal
$ surfpool start
```

By default, Surfpool automatically loads any programs and accounts your
transactions depend on from mainnet to the local validator.

## Surfpool Studio

Surfpool Studio provides a web-based interface for interacting with your local
validator. Use it to:

- View transactions details
- Inspect account data
- Airdrop SOL and other tokens using the UI faucet

To access Surfpool Studio:

1. Start your local validator with `surfpool start`
2. Open your browser and navigate to
