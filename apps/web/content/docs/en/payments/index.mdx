## Why Solana

- **Instant settlement**. Funds secured in ~400ms. No T+2, no batch processing, no reconciliation delays.
- **Sub-cent fees**. Base fee ~$0.001 per transaction. Batch multiple payments into a single transaction to reduce costs further.
- **Parallel execution**. Your payment flow runs on isolated throughput, unaffected by other network activity.
- **Familiar UX**. Sponsor or abstract away network fees so users pay in stablecoins without acquiring SOL.
- **Programmable**. Build custom payment applications with compliance built in (reconciliation memos, blacklists, automated tax accounting, etc.).
