description: Core concepts for sending and receiving payments on Solana
---

Before building payment flows on Solana, you'll need to understand five core concepts: wallets, stablecoins, token accounts, fees, and transactions. Solana payments map cleanly to multi-currency payment systems:

| Traditional Payment Model | Solana | Description |
|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| Customer ID / Account number | Wallet address | Unique identifier for an account holder |
| Currency (usd, eur) | Token Mint (USDG, USDC) | The asset type being transferred |
| Balance by currency | Token Account (ATA) | Holds a balance of a specific currency/mint |

Just as a bank customer has a single identity but holds separate balances for each currency, a Solana wallet has one address but a distinct token account for each asset it holds. Let's break down each component.

## Wallets: Senders and Receivers

Every payment involves two parties, each identified by a **wallet address**—a unique 32-byte public key (e.g., `7EcDhS...`).

- **Sender**: The wallet initiating the payment. Must hold sufficient stablecoin account balance and sign the transaction.
- **Receiver**: The destination wallet. Does not need to sign or hold an existing balance.
- **Fee Payer**: The optional fee payer wallet. Can be used to subsidize or enable stablecoin-only transactions between users.

Think of wallet addresses like bank account numbers: public, safe to share, and required to send or receive funds.

## Stablecoins

Stablecoins are referred to as "tokens" on Solana. Tokens represent an asset type on the network. Each token has a unique identifier called a "mint address". When building payment systems, you'll reference these mint addresses to identify the asset you are interacting with. Here are some common stablecoin mints on mainnet:

| Token | Issuer        | Mint Address                                   |
|-------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| USDC  | Circle        | `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v` |
| USDT  | Tether        | `Es9vMFrzaCERmJfrF4H2FYD4KCoNkY11McCe8BenwNYB` |
| PYUSD | PayPal        | `2b1kV6DkPAnxd5ixfnxCpjxmKwqjjaYmCZfHsFu24GXo` |
| USDG  | Paxos         | `2u1tszSeqZ3qBWF3uNGPFc8TzMk2tdiwknnRMWGWjGWH` |

When accepting payments, always validate the mint address and token program. Tokens can share names but have different issuers and underlying assets.

## Token Accounts

Wallets don't hold tokens directly. Instead, each wallet has authority over a **token account** for each type of token it holds. Payments are made by transferring tokens from a sender's token account to a receiver's token account of the same mint:

![Token Accounts](/docs/payments/payment-flow.png)

An **Associated Token Account** is a deterministic token account tied to a specific wallet and mint. Given a wallet address and mint, the ATA address is always the same.

1. **One ATA per mint**. A wallet has exactly one ATA for USDC, one for USDT, etc.
2. **Must exist before receiving**. You cannot send tokens to an ATA that doesn't exist.
3. **Sender typically creates**. If the receiver's ATA doesn't exist, the sender can create it as part of the payment transaction.

```typescript
import { findAssociatedTokenPda } from "@solana-program/token";

const [receiverATA] = await findAssociatedTokenPda({
  mint: USDG_MINT_ADDRESS,
  owner: receiverWallet.address,
  tokenProgram: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ADDRESS
});
```

Notice that we must specify a Token Program address. The Token Program is the program that manages token accounts on the Solana network. We cover this in more detail in the [Advanced Payments](/docs/payments/advanced-payments) section.

## Fees

Solana payments involve up to three cost components:

| Fee Type | SOL | USD (est.) | When |
|----------|-----|------------------|------|
| **Base transaction fee** | 5,000 lamports<sup>\*</sup> | ~$0.0007 | Every transaction (bundle multiple payments to amortize) |
| **Priority fee** | Variable | Variable | Optional; faster inclusion during congestion |
| **Account creation (rent)** | ~0.0029 SOL | ~$0.40 | Only when creating a new token account |

**Total cost per payment**: Under $0.001 for most transfers. If creating a new token account, expect ~$0.40 total.

You can abstract fees entirely so users never interact with SOL. See [Fee Abstraction](/docs/payments/fee-abstraction) for implementation patterns.

## Transactions and Instructions

A transaction is the atomic unit of execution on Solana—either every operation succeeds, or none do. Each transaction contains one or more instructions, which are individual commands (e.g., "transfer 10 USDC," "create token account").

A typical payment transaction might include two instructions: create the receiver's token account (if needed), then transfer tokens. Both execute atomically—no partial states. As you will see in [Payment Processing](/docs/payments/payment-processing), you can bundle multiple payments into a single transaction to reduce costs and increase throughput.

## Putting It Together

A typical payment flow:

1. **Gather input**. Get sender and receiver wallet addresses and the mint address of the token being transferred.
2. **Derive ATAs**. Determine the token accounts for both parties.
3. **Build and sign**. Construct the transaction with necessary transfer instructions, sign with the sender's key.
4. **Send & Confirm**. Transaction settles in under a second.
