description: Scale payments with gasless transactions and fee abstraction using Kora
---

Building a payment system that processes high volumes of transactions—payroll disbursements, merchant payouts, loyalty rewards—requires more than just sending tokens. You need to handle transaction fees at scale without requiring every user to hold SOL.

[**Kora**](https://launch.solana.com/products/kora) is Solana's signing infrastructure for gasless transactions. It lets users pay fees in any token (USDC, BONK, or your app's native token) or skip fees entirely with sponsored transactions.

## Why Kora for Payment Processing

- **Users never need SOL**. Remove the biggest UX barrier—users transact with only the tokens they hold.
- **Fee flexibility**. Collect fees in any stablecoin (e.g., USDC), subsidize transactions for VIP users, or monetize with your own token.
- **Production ready**. Secure validation, rate limiting, and monitoring built in. Deploy in minutes with Docker.
- **Simple integration**. JSON-RPC API with a TypeScript SDK that works with Solana Kit.

## How It Works

Kora acts as a paymaster that sponsors transaction fees on behalf of your users:

1. **User initiates** a payment (e.g., USDC transfer)
2. **Your app builds** the transaction with an additional token payment instruction to the Kora node operator
3. **User signs** authorizing the transfer
4. **Kora validates** the transaction and co-signs as fee payer
5. **Transaction lands**. User's payment executes, Kora receives token payment, SOL fees are handled

The user completes their transaction using only stablecoins while Kora handles all SOL-denominated network fees.

## Quick Integration

To use Kora, you will need an RPC endpoint from a Kora node operator (or you can [run your own Kora node](#running-your-own-kora-node)).

Install the Kora SDK:

```bash
pnpm add @solana/kora
```

Initialize the client and sign a gasless transaction:

```typescript
import { KoraClient } from "@solana/kora";

const kora = new KoraClient({ rpcUrl: "https://your-kora-instance" });

// Sign and send your transaction with Kora as fee payer
const { signature } = await kora.signAndSendTransaction({
  transaction: base64EncodedTransaction
});

console.log("Transaction Signature:", signature);
```

## Running Your Own Kora Node

For production deployments, run your own Kora instance with full control over:

- **Allowed programs**. Whitelist only the programs your app uses
- **Accepted tokens**. Define which tokens you accept for fee payment
- **Pricing**. Set margins and fee structures (or full subsidy)
- **Access Control**. Enable API and HMAC authentication
- **Rate limits**. Protect against abuse

```bash
cargo install kora-cli
kora --config path/to/kora.toml rpc start --signers-config path/to/signers.toml
```
