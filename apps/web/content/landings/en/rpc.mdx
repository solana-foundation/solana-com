# RPC Infrastructure

**Overview:** RPC requests are an application's gateway to the Solana cluster.
The requests are serviced by aptly named RPC Nodes, which are typically
dedicated to the task rather than participating in consensus. Nevertheless, from
an application user's perspective, poor RPC performance is no different from
poor cluster performance. To give your users a great experience and show off
Solana's speed and low-latency, it is important to have RPC infrastructure that
is up to the task.

**Development:** Developers are encouraged to use a local cluster during
development, especially in the early stages and for testing. Local clusters are
more flexible than the public offerings, granting the freedom to run unoptimized
early iterations. The easiest way to run a local cluster is with the
[solana-test-validator](https://docs.solana.com/developing/test-validator)
binary, included in the Solana CLI Tools suite. Once the application reaches a
stable state, deploying on a public cluster becomes more appropriate.

Like all code optimization tasks, when it comes to RPC requests, less is more.
Avoid making frequent, repetitive calls for the same data. Avoid building
clients that make RPC requests directly. "Backend-less dApps" are a myth; you
are just pummelling someone else's infrastructure. Cache expensive calls
(especially getProgramAccount, getSignaturesForAddress2, and getConfirmedBlock)
in an app-optimized way and serve your users from the cache. Taking the time to
optimize your code before going live can save you a lot of headaches from poor
user experience reports, and can significantly reduce your infrastructure spend.

## Free Services

Several providers offer free RPC access to the public Solana clusters. These
services are good for real-world testing, early demos, and small, private beta
programs. Keep in mind that you get exactly what you are paying for. Free
services typically do not autoscale, are rate-limited, offer no SLA, and are not
afraid to ban abusers. When an application is ready to be opened to the public,
it is time to invest in private RPC access.

## Private Services

Due to the variability in RPC requirements between applications, generalized
public RPC infrastructure rarely fits the bill. To ensure users get a good
experience, public facing applications need to secure their own private RPC
access. This will allow you to autoscale based on user demand, relax rate limits
according to your application, and have peace of mind that other applications'
users won't crowd yours out. Several organizations offer high-availability,
on-demand RPC services; see below. If none of the providers are a good fit and
you're up to the task of running your own RPC service, please reach out to the
Solana Foundation for guidance.
