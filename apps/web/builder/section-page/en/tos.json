If you are unsure whether the material infringes your copyright, you should seek legal advice. Submitting false claims may result in liability under <strong>17 U.S.C. § 512(f)</strong>, including damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees.</p><p><strong>Submitting a Counter-Notice</strong></p><p>If your content has been removed or disabled as a result of a DMCA notice and you believe it was wrongly removed, you may submit a counter-notice to the Foundation’s copyright agent.</p><p>A valid counter-notice must include:</p><ol><li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li><li>Identification of the material that was removed or disabled and the location where it appeared before removal;</li><li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification;</li><li>Your name, address, and telephone number; and</li><li>A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district court in which your address is located (or if outside the U.S., any judicial district in which the Foundation may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who filed the original DMCA notice.</li></ol><p>Upon receipt of a valid counter-notice, the Foundation may forward it to the party who submitted the original infringement notice. If that party does not file a court action within <strong>ten business days</strong>, the Foundation may, at its discretion, restore the removed material.</p><p><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></p><p><strong>Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with the Foundation and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. </strong>In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. **</p><p>(a) <strong>No Representative Actions. You and the Foundation agree that any dispute arising out of or related to this EULA or the Service is personal to you and the Foundation and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</strong></p><p>(b) <strong>Arbitration of Disputes. You and the Foundation</strong> <strong>waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to this EULA and the Service, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “<em>Disputes</em>”) resolved in court</strong>. Instead, for any Dispute that you have against the Foundation you agree to first contact the Foundation and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“<em>Notice</em>”) to the Foundation by email at <a href=\"mailto:operations@solana.foundation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">operations@solana.foundation</a> or by certified mail addressed to Dammstrasse 16, 6300 Zug, Switzerland. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and the Foundation cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Zug, Switzerland. You and the Foundation agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“<em>JAMS Rules</em>”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the <a href=\"https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>JAMS website</em></a> and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p><p>(c) You and the Foundation agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, <em>et seq</em>. (the “<em>FAA</em>”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p><p>(d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, the Foundation, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p><p>(e) You and the Foundation agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of \\$250 if you are a consumer), and the Foundation will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by the Foundation, the Foundation will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and the Foundation agree that the Kanton of Zug shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. []{#h.lnxbz9 .anchor}</p><p>(f) <strong>Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and the Foundation will not have the right to assert the claim.</strong> []{#h.35nkun2 .anchor}</p><p>(g) <strong>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section by mailing an opt-out notice to the Foundation at Dammstrasse 16, 6300 Zug, Switzerland</strong>. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the governing law and venue terms of this EULA.</p><p>(h) If any portion of this Section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section will be enforceable.</p><p><strong>GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE</strong></p><p>Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Service will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Switzerland. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration will be resolved in Zug, Switzerland.</p><p><strong>CORRECTIONS</strong></p><p>There may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information.

These third-party products and services are not offered by the Foundation and the Foundation is not responsible for any damages or losses that you might incur as a result of your use or purchase of these products and services.</p><p>You shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any other similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. You may have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>INDEMNIFICATION</strong></p><p>You hereby agree to defend, indemnify, and hold the Foundation harmless from and against any loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, made by any third party due to or arising out of: (1) use of the Service; (2) breach of this EULA; (3) any breach of your representations and warranties set forth in this EULA; (4) your violation of the rights of a third party, including but not limited to intellectual property rights; (5) any overt harmful act toward any other user of the Service with whom you connected via the Service; or (6) any breach of, or failure to comply with, applicable law.
