Minting tokens that have token extensions enabled allows the developer to natively have access to all of those programmability features, with the flexibility to decide which features to enable or disable.</p><p>A few examples of what is possible natively with token extensions:</p><ul><li>Confidential transfers: The ability to mask token balances and the amounts of token transfers, with auditability from the issuer of the token</li><li>Token gated transfers: The ability to control which wallets can receive tokens based on KYC identifiers</li><li>Transfer Fees: The issuer of the token can charge transfer fees to assist in monetization of transactions</li><li>Required metadata: Metadata about transfers can be mandatory, allowing payment attribution data to be bound to the transaction itself.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>There are several other extensions that enable additional rich functionality for digital asset issuers.</p>"
