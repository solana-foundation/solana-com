The RPC should be separated from the voting validator. It should only serve read / write requests and use the new components from the next evolution of validators for increased throughput. It can have a read only mode to only serve reads from network. It can also implement optional indexes based on the work that existing devOps team have done (like Triton and Helius).</p>"
