    "Solana is a layer one blockchain protocol built to process transactions at a massive scale. A proof-of-stake network supercharged by an innovative mechanism called proof of history, Solana is designed for lightning fast consensus with extremely low fees. The tech stack built by the Solana ecosystem gives builders the tools they need to create applications onchain using the languages they're used to — Rust, Python, Solidity, and more. It's time to start building.",
