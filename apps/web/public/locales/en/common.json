No financial advice. Just conversations on the biggest ideas shaping the future of the internet. Web3 is complicated, but never boring.",

Actions make it simple for developers to integrate the things you can do throughout the Solana ecosystem right into your environment, allowing you to perform blockchain transactions without needing to navigate away to a different app or webpage.</p><p>Blockchain links – or blinks – turn any Solana Action into a shareable, metadata-rich link. Blinks allow Action-aware clients (browser extension wallets, bots) to display additional capabilities for the user. On a website, a blink might immediately trigger a transaction preview in a wallet without going to a decentralized app; in Discord, a bot might expand the blink into an interactive set of buttons. This pushes the ability to interact on-chain to any web surface capable of displaying a URL.</p>"

By using the Solana Pay primitive as inspiration, Actions will change how users interact with blockchain in everyday environments.</p><p>In short, the Solana Pay spec isn't changing.

            "body": "<p>Staking is the process by which a SOL token holder (such as someone who purchased SOL tokens on an exchange) assigns some or all of their tokens to a particular validator or validators, which helps increase those validators’ voting weight. Assigning your tokens to add to a validator’s stake-weight is known as “delegating” your tokens. Delegating your tokens to a validator does NOT give the validator ownership or control over your tokens. At all times, you still control all your staked tokens that you may have chosen to delegate.</p><p>By staking tokens with a validator or validators, the token holder indicates a degree of trust in the validator they chose to delegate to. As validators amass larger amounts of stake delegations from different token holders, this acts as “proof” to the network that the validator’s consensus votes are trustworthy, and their votes are therefore weighted proportionally to the amount of stake the validator has attracted. By weighing the collective votes from all validators against the proportion of stake that has been delegated to them, the network reaches consensus by this Proof of Stake.</p><p>As different validators around the world may receive different pieces of information at different times, it is essential that the network is able to come to agreement about which transactions and data are continually added to the blockchain.

            "body": "<p>In an open and decentralized network like Solana, anyone can run a validator if they choose. A malicious validator or other bad actor could attempt to attack the network or to submit incorrect or fraudulent transactions for their own gain. Because of the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism described above, a single entity acting alone in this fraudulent manner would need to attract some amount of stake before any of their proposed activities would be weighed in the consensus vote. As more token holders choose to stake their SOL tokens to different validators across the network, and the total amount of stake on the network increases, it becomes increasingly difficult for even a coordinated and well-funded attacker to amass enough stake to single-handedly alter the outcome of a consensus vote for their own benefit. In short, the more stake that is delegated to many different validators across the network, the more safe and secure the network becomes for all of its users. Additionally, token holders who choose to stake their tokens and help secure the network in doing so, are eligible to receive staking rewards once they have delegated their tokens to one or more validators. More details on staking rewards are found below.</p>"

Slashing is any process by which some portion of stake delegated to a validator is destroyed as a punitive measure for malicious actions undertaken by the validator.</p><p>This mechanism incentivizes validators not to undertake such actions, as less stake delegated to a validator means that validator then accrues fewer rewards. Being slashed can also be seen as a reputational risk for retaining current or attracting potential future stake.</p><p>Slashing also poses a risk to token holders who could potentially lose some of their tokens if they have delegated to a validator which gets slashed. The presence of slashing could incentivize token holders to only delegate their tokens to validators they feel are reputable, and not to delegate all their tokens to a single or small number of validators.</p><p>On Solana, slashing is not automatic.

Token extensions enable the next generation of features for digital assets and stablecoins on the Solana blockchain by imbuing the assets with a native set of rich features ranging from confidentiality to token-gated access to required metadata.

In the past, application developers had to rely on a mix of ad-hoc protocols, code bases and projects to enable true programmability. Minting tokens that have token extensions enabled allows the developer to natively have access to all of those programmability features, with the flexibility to decide which features to enable or disable.</p><p>A few examples of what is possible natively with token extensions:</p><ul><li>Confidential transfers: The ability to mask token balances and the amounts of token transfers, with auditability from the issuer of the token</li><li>Token gated transfers: The ability to control which wallets can receive tokens based on KYC identifiers</li><li>Transfer Fees: The issuer of the token can charge transfer fees to assist in monetization of transactions</li><li>Required metadata: Metadata about transfers can be mandatory, allowing payment attribution data to be bound to the transaction itself.</li></ul><p>There are several other extensions that enable additional rich functionality for digital asset issuers.</p>"

This is by no means an exhaustive list of value businesses that could be built on Solana, but merely a starting point for those looking for that first spark of an idea.</p>",
        "1": "<h2><span style=\"color: rgb(153, 69, 255);\">DePIN</span></h2><h4><strong><em>Energy DePIN</em></strong></h4><p>The world's energy infrastructure is going to change dramatically in the coming years and decades. July 2024 saw two of the hottest days for Earth on record. The heat is on (pun intended) for nations to shift their energy consumption towards sustainable / green sources and governments are now providing 100s of billions in funding to accelerate the shift to green energy.</p><p>There's an opportunity to build a truly optimized energy business via token incentives and the DePIN playbook</p><ul><li>Users earn token rewards for installing valuable energy hardware (e.g., solar panels, batteries)</li><li>Users also earn token rewards for adjusting their energy consumption behavior - users get notifications each day advising them on when to run energy-heavy appliances (get people to reduce usage when prices are expected to spike, and incentivize them to consume when prices are low/negative).</li></ul>",
        "2": "<ul><li>\\\"Earn 3x token rewards for running your dishwasher between 12pm - 4pm\\\"</li><li>Turn each homeowner into a mini \\\"energy trader\\\"</li></ul>",
        "3": "<h2><span style=\"color: rgb(153, 69, 255);\">Stablecoins / Payments / Commerce / PayFi</span></h2><h4><em>Buy Now, Pay Never?</em></h4><p>Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) has become an increasingly popular payment method with the rise of firms like Affirm. But what if we could finance purchases without ever \"paying\"?</p><p>Imagine paying for a Messari Pro subscription by staking a yielding asset (e.g., SOL, ETH etc.) to an onchain account that retains your custody on the principle asset, but programmatically deducts some of the yield each month to pay for the subscription service. The arbitrage / opportunity here is one of psychology - Messari Pro still costs you the same amount of money, but because the way the payment is happening is via deduction of yield for an asset you want to own anyways, it feels \"free\". If you ever want to unsubscribe, just unstake your asset.</p>",
        "4": "<h4><em>P2P Marketplace, Powered by Stablecoins</em></h4><p>P2P markets like Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist have become massive centers of mostly-offline commerce. These platforms aggregate P2P demand and supply, don't usually facilitate commercial transactions, and generate revenue through ads, etc. They've amassed huge audiences: in a normal month, 1.2B shoppers buy something on Facebook Marketplace, while 250MM worldwide sellers use the platform.</p><p>But scams &amp; fraud, ugly disputes, \"ghosting,\" and spam can often disrupt the user experience. Many of these problems could be solved with blockchain. Help sellers find qualified buyers and filter out the noise by requiring proof of funds via transparent crypto wallet balances, or locking up deposits in escrow programs. Increase buyer and seller protection with smart contracts, allowing for easy escrow and dispute management. With programmable money at the backbone of a new marketplace, the design possibilities are endless.</p>",
        "5": "<h4><em>End-to-End Payments Solution</em></h4><p>Consumers are feeling the cost of point-of-sale transaction fees now more than ever. This is a prime opportunity for crypto payment rails to capture market share. The blocker is that most consumers don't want to or don't know how to use crypto. Furthermore, merchants need fiat dollars and also don't want to deal with crypto complexity. There exists an opportunity to create an end-to-end payments solution on Solana using stablecoins, Solana Pay, gasless transactions, and integrated fiat on/off ramps to enable a payments rail that does not charge 3%+ at every sale.</p>",
        "6": "<h2><span style=\"color: rgb(153, 69, 255);\">Creator Economy</span></h2><h4><em>Creator Token-Based Models with Long-Term Alignment</em></h4><p>A notable challenge with creator token based apps (e.g., Friend.tech, Fantasy Top) is that the incentives are fundamentally misaligned between creators and token owners. Creators want lots of people to buy their token but after the primary sale of their tokens, creators only monetize when there's churn in their user base and they earn fees on the trading of their creator token / key. This means a creator's incentive to stay engaged goes down as soon as their token price starts to fall and token holders have no incentive to stay involved once the initial novelty of owning the token wears off.</p><p>Web2 platforms solve this via recurring payment models (e.g., Twitch Subscriptions). It's important for future creator-token based apps to design with some analogous long-term financial alignment between creator and user.</p>",
        "7": "<h4><em>Social Apps that Leverage Solana Itself as the Social Graph</em></h4><p>Many in crypto are building open social graph infrastructure. While there's an opportunity to do that, there's an even bigger opportunity to build consumer apps that leverage an untapped rich existing open social graph - Solana itself. Think about the the kind of \"social\" history / information carried by your wallets:</p><ul><li>Are you a diamond hand or paper hand? (look at how many now successful tokens you sold too early, how many tokens you held through 90%+ drawdowns)</li><li>Which communities are you really an OG for? (look at when you first owned a given NFT / token)</li></ul>",

        "9": "<p>This tweet from 0xDesigner is just one example of the kind of applications / experiences that could be built leveraging the history of user behavior captured on Solana. The opportunity lies in creating a product / UX around the 'social graph' of Solana that already houses a large user base and rich user behavior history.</p>",
        "10": "<h4><em>IP Infrastructure</em></h4><p>More and more content is being generated (and increasingly generated by machines). There's a huge question around how do we handle the veracity of, and economic rights around, the IP associated with this content explosion. Solana has seen a plethora of rich content coming on-chain in the past year. NFTs and social tokens are a v0 of this.</p><p>The product here is an on-chain framework for creating IP and then monetizing it (via licensing / sale) to streamline the process relative to the world today (where it's mostly onerous processes with a lot of lawyers negotiating licensing deals). Specific implementations might be, content remixing app, co-creation hub, AI-generated assets marketplace, or a brand licensing market.</p>",
        "11": "<h2>AI</h2><h4><em>Token-Incentivized Data Collection</em></h4><p>Access to high quality, unique data increasingly seems like it's going to be the bottleneck for the improvement of AI models like LLMs. There are large existing web2 businesses (e.g., Scale AI) serving this need of helping model builders acquire differentiated data. Targeted token incentives are potentially powerful (and capital efficient) way to drive explosive data gathering for niche and hard-to-collect/generate pieces of data.</p><ul><li>Get users to install software or hardware that collects and transmits their data (e.g., Grass, Uprock on software side, Ambient, Dimo on hardware side)</li><li>Incentivize users to label data / give human feedback for RLHF (e.g., Synesis One, Hivemapper)</li></ul><p>A few examples:</p><ul><li>Grass uses token incentives to get people to install a browser extension that crawls the web when the user is inactive. This data has many uses, including serving as data collection for non-English LLMs (because Grass has access to non-English IP addresses via their 1m+ install base)</li><li>AI calorie tracking apps like Eato have users take photos of food and then use AI models to provide a calorie breakdown for the food. If the model mislabels a photo, users can submit notes with corrections that serve as human feedback to improve the model. What if the app also rewarded users with a token to help them build a habit of taking photos and submitting corrections? While normal app \"points\" can incentivize similar behaviors, web3 tokens have the potential to drive more explosive growth (see StepN, Hamster Kombat).</li></ul>",
        "12": "<h2><span style=\"color: rgb(153, 69, 255);\">Games</span></h2><h4><em>\"Fully\" Onchain Games</em></h4><p>It seems increasingly likely that the breakthrough web3 game will not look or play like many of the games we play today and that asset ownership isn't the only, or even primary, use for blockchains in gaming. And instead, the breakthrough will come from \"Fully Onchain Games\" (FOCG) that use blockchains as a decentralized compute layer that fully expose a game's state and logic (learn more <a href=\"https://www.bitkraft.vc/insights/fully-onchain-games-thesis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).</p><p>Much more experimentation is needed in the design of FOCG. In particular, there needs to be:</p><ul><li>More focus on:</li></ul>",
        "13": "<ul><li>Unique fun game loops that lean into the potential of game state/logic being exposed</li><li>Sustainable economics - token incentives are crypto's superpower, and successful games will almost certainly lean into this power.</li></ul>",
        "14": "<ul><li>Less focus on:</li></ul>",
        "15": "<ul><li>High production value (good graphics etc.) - at this early stage of onchain games, it's hard to justify spending resources on \"polish\". Figure out an engaging and unique core loop and then polish later</li><li>Having every piece of game state or logic onchain</li></ul>",
        "16": "<ul><li>Think about which pieces of game state and logic are highest leverage to expose to the community and focus on having those onchain . Rest can stay offchain initially if that enables faster iteration</li></ul>",
        "17": "<h4><em>Geo-Based Gamified Apps</em></h4><p>Apps like Pokemon Go show the power of gamified experience to get people to take action in the physical world and StepN demonstrates how token incentives can also motivate outdoor activity. We think these geo-based app experiences can be taken a level further specifically by tying an IRL advertising component to them.</p><p>E.g., a StepN-esque experience where users earn tokens for walking around, but only when they enter specific locations</p><ul><li>Stores / restaurants can advertise by purchasing and offering token rewards for users who enter their store</li><li>Want to gift a friend a meal at a new local restaurant? Buy tokens and \"place\" them at the restaurant so that your friend can claim them when they arrive at the restaurant</li><li>Stake tokens to your favorite stores/restaurants to earn</li></ul>",
        "18": "<ul><li>Stores/restaurants with a lot of staked tokens are ranked higher within the app (more easily discovered by users) </li></ul>",
        "19": "<h2><span style=\"color: rgb(153, 69, 255);\">Asset Tokenization</span></h2><h4><em>RWA Aggregated Investment Portal</em></h4><p>Many assets have been tokenized over the last few years, yet it is quite hard for the average investor to know where and how to get access to these investments. An aggregated investment portal where buyers are matched with asset supply could be significantly beneficial for both sides of RWA markets</p><p>For example, it could be a heavily abstracted user interface where it lists investment opportunities in plain english. Kind of like a Kickstarter-type landing page. It explains the asset, yield opportunities or projected appreciation rates, and any other information they might need in order to make an educated decision without all the blockchain mumbo-jumbo and jargon. The ideal state of a product like this is that its integrated into a brokerage like Fidelity or Schwab where people can easily see RWA investment opportunities and seamlessly invest into them.</p>",
        "20": "<h2><span style=\"color: rgb(153, 69, 255);\">Infrastructure</span></h2><h4><em>Onchain Identity</em></h4><p>Tokenized on-chain identities that allow identification while preserving privacy (only revealing info required for using specific app or even not reveal using zk tech). Examples on other chains going into that direction are:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.hakata.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.hakata.io/</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.polimec.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.polimec.org/</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.privado.id/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.privado.id/</a></li></ul>",
        "21": "<h4><em>Light RPC</em></h4><p>Today the hardware requirements for an RPC are significant. As the ecosystem is developing additional validators those validators include upgraded components like higher throughput and better memory / disk tradeoff.</p><p>The goal for this project would be to develop an RPC that is faster and requires less hardware. The RPC should be separated from the voting validator. It should only serve read / write requests and use the new components from the next evolution of validators for increased throughput. It can have a read only mode to only serve reads from network. It can also implement optional indexes based on the work that existing devOps team have done (like Triton and Helius).</p>"

Developed by the Coinbase Development Platform team, x402 enables any API or web service to require payment before serving content. It fixes a foundational omission in the web stack, making native payments possible between clients and servers through a universal standard for monetizing digital resources. Learn more about its development at x402.org."

        "content": "In a world of agentic payments, the performance of the rails matter. Already traditional payments with stablecoins on the network now exceed $11B in circulation and account for 200M+ transactions every month. Solana's 400ms finality and $0.00025 transaction costs make it an efficient settlement layer for x402 payments. Whether it's an AI agent making thousands of API calls or a user accessing premium content, Solana enables instant, low-cost payments that provides stable, predictable pricing for global services. Further, its low latency makes it easy to add layers like escrow and dispute resolution without noticeably increasing transfer time."

        "title": "Powering the Agent Economy",
        "content": " AI is no longer confined to generating text or images. Improvements in tool use and context protocols have accelerated the ability of agents to effectively use tools and work on tasks with minimal human intervention. Agents will pay for services, fund their compute, manage subscriptions, and take action on behalf of their users in an increasingly independent fashion. This shift signals the rise of agentic payments, a new layer of the internet economy where machine to machine transactions make up a growing portion of services demand. Today these volumes are early, but growing. Since the launch of x402 on Solana this summer, we have seen 35M+ transactions and $10M+ volumes processed over x402. For this economy to scale, it needs rails that are fast, final, and built for autonomy. That is what x402 on Solana provides."

This section also establishes procedures for\ncounter-notifications in cases where a user disputes the removal of content.\n\nTo submit a DMCA takedown notice, please provide the following information:\n\n1. **Your electronic or physical signature** (typing your full name in an email\n   or webform is sufficient);\n2. **A description of the copyrighted work** you believe has been infringed,\n   along with a URL or location where we can review the original work;\n3. **Identification of the material** that you claim is infringing and its\n   location (such as a URL) on the Foundation's website, application, or\n   service;\n4. **Your contact information**, including name, address, telephone number, and\n   email address;\n5. **A statement** that you have a good faith belief that the use of the\n   material is not authorized by the copyright owner, their agent, or the law;\n   and\n6. **A statement under penalty of perjury** that the information in your notice\n   is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on\n   behalf of the owner.\n\nPlease submit your notice to the Foundation's designated copyright agent:\n\n**Solana Foundation**\n\nAttn: Copyright Agent\n\n16 Dammstrasse, 6300 Zug Switzerland\n\nEmail: [dmcaagent@solana.org](mailto:dmcaagent@solana.org)\n\n+41 41 562 73 63\n\nBy submitting a notice, you acknowledge that the Foundation may share the\ninformation you provide with the individual who posted the allegedly infringing\ncontent.\n\n**Important Legal Notice:** Copyright law requires that you consider applicable\ndefenses such as fair use before submitting a takedown request. If you are\nunsure whether the material infringes your copyright, you should seek legal\nadvice. Submitting false claims may result in liability under **17 U.S.C. §\n512(f)**, including damages, costs, and attorneys' fees.\n\n**Submitting a Counter-Notice**\n\nIf your content has been removed or disabled as a result of a DMCA notice and\nyou believe it was wrongly removed, you may submit a counter-notice to the\nFoundation's copyright agent.\n\nA valid counter-notice must include:\n\n1. Your physical or electronic signature;\n2. Identification of the material that was removed or disabled and the location\n   where it appeared before removal;\n3. A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that\n   the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or\n   misidentification;\n4. Your name, address, and telephone number; and\n5. A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district\n   court in which your address is located (or if outside the U.S., any judicial\n   district in which the Foundation may be found), and that you will accept\n   service of process from the person who filed the original DMCA notice.\n\nUpon receipt of a valid counter-notice, the Foundation may forward it to the\nparty who submitted the original infringement notice. If that party does not\nfile a court action within **ten business days**, the Foundation may, at its\ndiscretion, restore the removed material.\n\n#### DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n**Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to\narbitrate certain disputes and claims with the Foundation and limits the manner\nin which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by\nfollowing the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions\nor arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision.** In addition,\narbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.\n\n(a) **No Representative Actions. You and the Foundation agree that any dispute\narising out of or related to this EULA or the Service is personal to you and the\nFoundation and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual\naction, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any\nother type of representative proceeding.**\n\n(b) **Arbitration of Disputes. You and the Foundation** waive your rights to a\njury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to this EULA\nand the Service, including claims related to privacy and data security,\n(collectively, \"_Disputes_\") resolved in court. Instead, for any Dispute that\nyou have against the Foundation you agree to first contact the Foundation and\nattempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your\nclaim (\"_Notice_\") to the Foundation by email at\n[operations@solana.foundation](mailto:operations@solana.foundation) or by\ncertified mail addressed to Dammstrasse 16, 6300 Zug, Switzerland. The Notice\nmust (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone\nnumber; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (c) set forth the\nspecific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that\ndescribed above. If you and the Foundation cannot reach an agreement to resolve\nthe Dispute within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either\nparty may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or,\nunder the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All Disputes\nsubmitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration\nbefore one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Zug, Switzerland.\nYou and the Foundation agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the\nJAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (\"_JAMS Rules_\"). The most\nrecent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the\n[JAMS website](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/) and are\nhereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have\nread and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS\nRules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for\nany reason.\n\n(c) You and the Foundation agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and\nthat the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and procedurally\ngoverned by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, _et seq._ (the \"_FAA_\"),\nto the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these\nTerms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make\nall procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any\nremedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to\ndetermine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an\nindividual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's\nclaims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside\nover any proceeding involving more than one individual.\n\n(d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged\ninformation relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, the Foundation, and you\nwill maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and\nawards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of\nthe arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have\nthe authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless\nthe law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to\nthe extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the\narbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a\npreliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration\naward or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required\nby law or judicial decision.\n\n(e) You and the Foundation agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will\npay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and the\nFoundation will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration\ninitiated by the Foundation, the Foundation will pay all JAMS fees and costs.\nYou and the Foundation agree that the Kanton of Zug shall have exclusive\njurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.\n\n(f) **Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose;\notherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and the\nFoundation will not have the right to assert the claim.**\n\n(g) **You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the\ndate you first accepted the terms of this Section by mailing an opt-out notice\nto the Foundation at Dammstrasse 16, 6300 Zug, Switzerland.** In order to be\neffective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and\nclearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of\nbinding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the\ngoverning law and venue terms of this EULA.\n\n(h) If any portion of this Section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for\nany reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from\nthese Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have\nno impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section or the parties' ability to\ncompel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to\nthis Section; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a\nclass, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be\nlitigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and\nthe parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the\noutcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this\nSection is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive\nrelief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed\nto be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section will be\nenforceable.\n\n#### GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE\n\nAny dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Service will be\ngoverned by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of\nSwitzerland. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration\nwill be resolved in Zug, Switzerland.\n\n#### CORRECTIONS\n\nThere may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors,\ninaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and\nvarious other information.

    },
    "content": "# RPC Infrastructure\n\n**Overview:** RPC requests are an application's gateway to the Solana cluster. The requests are serviced by aptly named RPC Nodes, which are typically dedicated to the task rather than participating in consensus. Nevertheless, from an application user's perspective, poor RPC performance is no different from poor cluster performance. To give your users a great experience and show off Solana's speed and low-latency, it is important to have RPC infrastructure that is up to the task.\n\n**Development:** Developers are encouraged to use a local cluster during development, especially in the early stages and for testing. Local clusters are more flexible than the public offerings, granting the freedom to run unoptimized early iterations. The easiest way to run a local cluster is with the [solana-test-validator](https://docs.solana.com/developing/test-validator) binary, included in the Solana CLI Tools suite. Once the application reaches a stable state, deploying on a public cluster becomes more appropriate.\n\nLike all code optimization tasks, when it comes to RPC requests, less is more. Avoid making frequent, repetitive calls for the same data. Avoid building clients that make RPC requests directly. \"Backend-less dApps\" are a myth; you are just pummelling someone else's infrastructure. Cache expensive calls (especially getProgramAccount, getSignaturesForAddress2, and getConfirmedBlock) in an app-optimized way and serve your users from the cache. Taking the time to optimize your code before going live can save you a lot of headaches from poor user experience reports, and can significantly reduce your infrastructure spend.\n\n## Free Services\n\nSeveral providers offer free RPC access to the public Solana clusters. These services are good for real-world testing, early demos, and small, private beta programs. Keep in mind that you get exactly what you are paying for. Free services typically do not autoscale, are rate-limited, offer no SLA, and are not afraid to ban abusers. When an application is ready to be opened to the public, it is time to invest in private RPC access.\n\n**Some free RPC providers:**\n\n**Testnet**\n\n- [https://api.testnet.solana.com](https://api.testnet.solana.com/)\n\n**Devnet**\n\n- [https://api.devnet.solana.com](https://api.devnet.solana.com/)\n- [https://rpc.ankr.com/solana_devnet](https://rpc.ankr.com/solana_devnet)\n- [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/solana-rpc-nodes)\n- [OrbitFlare](https://orbitflare.com/)\n- [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/chains/sol)\n- [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/build-better-with-solana/)\n\n**Mainnet-beta**\n\n- [https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com](https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/)\n- [Syndica](https://syndica.io/)\n- [Blockdaemon](https://www.blockdaemon.com/protocols/solana)\n- [https://rpc.ankr.com/solana](https://rpc.ankr.com/solana)\n- [GetBlock](https://getblock.io/nodes/sol/)\n- [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/solana-rpc-nodes)\n- [OrbitFlare](https://orbitflare.com/)\n- [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/chains/sol)\n- [InstantNodes](https://instantnodes.io/)\n- [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/build-better-with-solana/)\n\n## Private Services\n\nDue to the variability in RPC requirements between applications, generalized public RPC infrastructure rarely fits the bill. To ensure users get a good experience, public facing applications need to secure their own private RPC access. This will allow you to autoscale based on user demand, relax rate limits according to your application, and have peace of mind that other applications' users won't crowd yours out. Several organizations offer high-availability, on-demand RPC services; see below. If none of the providers are a good fit and you're up to the task of running your own RPC service, please reach out to the Solana Foundation for guidance.\n\n- [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/chains/sol) (shared)\n- [Triton/RPC Pool](https://triton.one/) (shared and dedicated)\n- [Chainflow](https://chainflow.io/contact/) (dedicated)\n- [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/build-better-with-solana/) (shared and dedicated)\n- [GenesysGo](https://genesysgo.com/) (dedicated)\n- [Figment](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up?service=solana) (shared)\n- [Foundation Server Program](https://solana.org/delegation-program) - bare metal at a discount to run-your-own\n- [Syndica](https://syndica.io/)\n- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/solana) (shared)\n- [Blockdaemon](https://blockdaemon.com/marketplace/solana/)\n- [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/)\n- [GetBlock](https://getblock.io/nodes/sol/)\n- [Helius](https://helius.dev/solana-rpc-nodes)\n- [OrbitFlare](https://orbitflare.com/) (shared and dedicated)\n- [NOWNodes](https://nownodes.io/nodes/solana-sol) (shared and dedicated)\n- [InstantNodes](https://instantnodes.io/) (hybrids)"

From the beginning, Solana supported the ability for programs to create and manage specific accounts (i.e., directly initiate transactions). This feature, extending account abstraction capabilities in Solana, is known as Program Derived Addresses (PDAs). Solana programs, unlike data accounts, are executable accounts containing executable code. With PDAs, developers can set rules and mechanisms for transaction signatures, allowing various on-chain actions to be autonomously authorized on behalf of a controlled account (PDA) recognized and approved by the Solana network.

    "intro": "<p>Both Ethereum and Solana are known to use PoS (Proof of Stake) for their consensus mechanisms. They both generate blocks through validators based on staking. Although they fundamentally use the same consensus, Ethereum currently records about 30 TPS (transactions per second), while Solana boasts 4000 TPS. This difference indirectly shows how consensus can significantly impact block generation speed. This chapter will delve into the differences between the two chains.</p>",
    "ethereumsOriginalConsensus": "<h3><strong>Ethereum's original consensus</strong></h3><p>Originally, Ethereum adopted the Proof of Work(PoW) method, which is still used by Bitcoin. After the Merge upgrade in August 2022, Ethereum transitioned from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, and now employs PoS as mentioned above.</p>",
    "ethereumsCurrentConsensus": "<h3><strong>Ethereum's current consensus</strong></h3><p>At its core, Ethereum uses PoS, but it specifically employs a consensus algorithm called Gasper. Gasper is a combination of Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (Casper-FFG) and the LMD-GHOST fork choice algorithm. Before delving into Gasper, it's important to note that Ethereum initially generates blocks based on the PoW-based Nakamoto consensus. The Nakamoto consensus follows the Longest Chain Rule, selecting the longest chain in the blockchain during a fork. Therefore, Ethereum hasn't completely abandoned PoW; it retains basic block generation under PoW while integrating PoS elements on top.</p><p>Casper (Casper-FFG), a part of Gasper, upgrades certain blocks to a \"finalized\" state, ensuring network participants are synchronized with the regular chain. It was initially proposed for the transitional phase from a PoW-based chain to PoS during the Merge upgrade and now contributes partially to the larger Gasper algorithm. LMD-GHOST (Latest Message Driven Greediest Heaviest Observed SubTree) is a fork choice algorithm used to select the most valid and trustworthy chain among various forks. In case of a fork generating multiple new blocks, validators vote through attestation messages to determine which block to append to the existing chain. These attestations follow a path from the genesis block to the latest block (leaf block), selecting the block backed by the most recent attestations.</p>",
    "solanasConsensusHeading": "<h3><strong>Solana's consensus</strong></h3>",
    "solanasConsensusBody": "<p>What are the corresponding technological components in Solana for each of Ethereum's consensus algorithms? The answer lies in Tower BFT, which supports PoS.</p><p>First, let's understand BFT and PBFT. BFT is a method for achieving reliable consensus among nodes in a distributed system, stemming from the 'Byzantine Generals Problem.' It ensures the system operates correctly even if some nodes are malicious or unreliable. PBFT is a practical implementation of BFT that guarantees system finality and consistency by securing agreement on all transactions among all nodes.</p><p>Tower BFT adopts a variant of PBFT, with one fundamental difference: Proof of History (PoH) acts as a global clock before consensus. In Solana's implementation, PoH is used as the network clock, arranging the order of blocks, transactions, and data.</p><p>Ethereum often inefficiently updates its entire network state for specific transactions, and transactions may not be processed sequentially. In contrast, Solana utilizes PoH (Proof of History) to support PoS. To determine the cryptographic time between two events, a series of computational steps are required. For example, consider two photos: one of an apple and another of the photo being taken. We can infer that the photo of the apple was taken first. Solana tracks their sequence by adding timestamps to data, ensuring no mix-up in its structures.</p><p>Using PoH, Tower BFT effectively determines the order of blocks, transactions, and data through timestamp verification. Therefore, validators can conclusively decide on forks, opting for the chain most trusted by votes. Ethereum lacks a timestamp concept like PoH for overall state synchronization, forcing validators to calculate from previous hashes to select a fork. Conversely, Solana's Tower BFT, based on PoH, effortlessly achieves consensus without needing full block verification.</p><p>Therefore, the comparison can be summarized as follows:</p>",

This is different from Ethereum, where you deploy a new smart contract for every token. Why is there only one main smart contract for tokens on Solana?</p><p>The <a href=\"https://solana.com/docs/core/accounts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Solana Account Model </a>separates the state from execution logic on Solana, making interfaces very difficult to create like ERC20 does on Ethereum. Instead of multiple smart contracts, the single Token Program handles tokens in separate “accounts” known as “mint accounts”, while user tokens are stored in individual “token accounts”. The account model gives a significant benefit in program reusability and predetermined definition, avoiding unknown side effects of anyone being able to write their own ERC20 token functions.</p>",
        "tokensNoContractAddress": "<h3><strong>Tokens Don’t Have Contract Addresses, Only Mint Addresses</strong></h3><p>On Ethereum, each token is uniquely identified by its Contract Address. In Solana, each token is uniquely identified by a Mint Address. The underlying idea is similar—this is the on-chain pointer for that specific token. But because the Solana Token Program is universal, you don’t deploy a separate “contract address.” Instead, you supply the Solana runtime with a new mint account.</p>",
        "noApprovalFlow": "<h3><strong>No Approval Flow Needed</strong></h3><p>On Ethereum, transferring ERC20 tokens between two addresses often requires <code>approve</code> + <code>transferFrom</code> if you're doing it on behalf of a user. On Solana, each user already has an ATA (<a href=\"https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Associated token accounts</a>) recognized by the Token Program.

On Solana, a single transaction can call multiple smart contract functions atomically, removing the need for the approval flow. Another difference is that everything is stored in a token account on Solana, keeping the details of the owner’s tokens separate from the other state.</p>",
        "tokenMetadata": "<h3><strong>Where’s the Token Metadata?</strong></h3><p>One thing you may have noticed in the code is that there wasn’t any token metadata in the smart contract itself. Today this metadata is handled by the Token Metadata Program on Solana, allowing metadata to be extended as people wish to have more fields associated with their token. This does mean there’s a separate function to add to a transaction(remember, SVM can handle multiple in order function calls in a single transaction) to add name, symbol, description and other fields to your Token.</p>",

That means the mint authority can move the first tokens without an extra whitelist update call. Later, whenever someone calls transfer_checked, the Token 2022 program CPI-invokes the hook's execute function, passing the five fixed accounts (source token, mint, destination token, owner, meta list) plus the forwarded whitelist PDA. The hook checks that the owners of both token accounts appear in whitelist.allowed; if either is missing it raises SrcNotAllowed or DstNotAllowed, rolling back the whole transaction, otherwise it returns Ok(()) and the transfer finalizes.

Next you create a brand-new Token-2022 mint that points to this hook by passing --transfer-hook $HOOK_ID, while also naming the admin wallet as freeze- and claw-back authority; Solana prints the resulting MINT_ADDRESS. Because Token-2022 needs to know which extra accounts to pass into the hook, you immediately run anchor run init-meta, which calls the hook's initializer and stores WL_PDA in the mint's extra-account-meta list. This step is done only once. Now the mint is wired for KYC, so you can freely mint initial supply to yourself; the hook is not invoked on mint operations. Finally you transfer tokens to another wallet: at that moment Token-2022 invokes the hook, which checks both sender and receiver against the on-chain whitelist. If both are listed the transfer lands; if either is missing the hook throws an error and the whole transaction is rolled back, giving you ERC-3643-style compliance in a single Solana transaction."

This means that whenever developers want to implement advanced features such as multisig or social recovery they typically have to rely on an EOA to trigger those contract functions and pay transaction fees, which can lead to a less streamlined user experience.</p><p>To address this, ERC-4337 introduces a separate mempool and “bundler” (block producer) mechanism that does not require major protocol-layer changes. Through this system, contract accounts (CAs) can directly initiate and sign transactions. In doing so, developers gain the flexibility to implement features like social recovery, fee sponsorship, session keys, and other custom security models, ultimately making Account Abstraction a reality on Ethereum.</p>",

Below are the main reasons why Solana inherently addresses many of the issues that ERC-4337 seeks to solve:</p>",
        "allAccounts": "<h3>All Accounts as Flexible Data Storage</h3><p>Solana treats every account as a flexible “storage bucket,” capable of holding arbitrary data. In other words, an account on Solana is not limited to storing a simple balance or nonce:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Data Persistence: Each account can store state and metadata for various use cases, similar to how a file in a filesystem can contain different types of content.&nbsp;</li><li>Ownership: An account on Solana specifies which program (smart contract) owns it. That ownership determines how the account’s stored data is controlled, updated, or validated.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This design naturally allows for much broader state management compared to traditional EOAs on Ethereum, which are restricted to storing only balances and nonces.</p>",
        "programsExecutable": "<h3>Programs as Executable Accounts</h3><p>Solana smart contracts are called programs, and each program is also an account, specifically, an executable account. By contrast, a non-executable (data) account is used to store actual state (e.g., user balances, configuration data, or other custom info):&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Program Account: Contains compiled code that the Solana runtime can execute.&nbsp;</li><li>Data Account: Holds data and assets that a program manages.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Because programs exist as dedicated accounts, developers can easily separate a contract’s logic from the storage of user or application data. In many ways, this is more modular than Ethereum’s approach, where code and state reside within the same contract account.</p>",
        "pdasCore": "<h3><strong>Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) - The Core of Solana’s Native AA</strong></h3><p>A close parallel to ERC-4337’s “contract account as a transaction originator” is Solana’s Program Derived Address (PDA) feature. A PDA is an address generated by a Solana program itself, rather than one derived from a private key. This has key implications:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>No Private Key Needed</strong></p><ul><li>A PDA can effectively “sign” on-chain instructions without having a private key. The Solana runtime recognizes that a specific program is authorized to act on behalf of this address.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Custom Rules and Logic&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Because a PDA is tied to a specific program, developers can embed rules such as spending limits, whitelists/blacklists, social recovery mechanisms, or session-like permissions, directly in on-chain logic.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Self-Executing Contracts&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>On Ethereum, account abstraction generally requires external calls (from an EOA or via the ERC-4337 bundler) for the contract to do anything. On Solana, a program that controls a PDA can autonomously manage state transitions under the constraints of the Solana runtime.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>From paying transaction fees on behalf of users to enabling advanced multisig flows or automated rebalancing in DeFi protocols, PDAs offer a range of possibilities that are native to Solana.</p>",
        "cpiSupport": "<h3><strong>Built-In Support for Complex Interactions (CPI)</strong></h3><p>Solana also supports Cross-Program Invocation (CPI), which allows programs, and by extension their PDAs, to interact directly with one another. This is essential for composability:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>A program can call another program using CPI, while retaining control over its PDAs and adhering to the Solana runtime’s security model.&nbsp;</li><li>Developers do not need external bundlers or specialized “entry points” to chain multiple contract calls. Instead, they orchestrate everything via straightforward CPI calls within a single transaction flow.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>For account abstraction, CPI means seamless composability among different programs and PDAs precisely the kind of flexibility ERC-4337 is designed to enable on Ethereum.</p>",
        "comparisonIntro": "<h3><strong>A Comparison with ERC-4337 </strong></h3><p>When viewed side by side, Solana’s account model and Ethereum’s ERC-4337 solution both aim to provide more dynamic, programmable user accounts. However:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Ethereum (ERC-4337): Relies on a bundler and a specialized mempool to let contract accounts originate transactions without deep protocol changes.&nbsp;</li><li>Solana: Naturally supports an environment where any account can store custom data, and where programs can own PDAs that operate without private keys.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

The ERC721 standard is utilized to represent individual tokens with distinct identifiers. Unlike ERC20 tokens, ERC721 tokens can possess unique characteristics and functions.</p>",
        "tokenProgram": "<h2><strong>The Token Program (Plus Metadata)</strong></h2><p>On Solana, there isn't a new smart contract for every NFT collection. Instead, NFTs are created under a single on-chain <a href=\"https://spl.solana.com/token\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Token Program</a>, the same one used for fungible tokens - just minted with a supply of 1. To store extra NFT details (like name, symbol, image URI, etc.), developers use the Metaplex Token Metadata Program.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.metaplex.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Metaplex</a> Metadata is an open-source protocol and platform for NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and digital assets. Built on the Solana blockchain, Metaplex facilitates adding additional metadata to tokens on Solana.</p><p>This is different from Ethereum, where you typically deploy a brand-new ERC721 contract for each collection. Why is there a single main program for NFTs on Solana? It's due to <a href=\"https://solana.com/docs/core/accounts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Solana Account model</a>, which separates state (the data) from execution logic (the program). Because Solana reuses the Token Program for all tokens, you don't need to write and deploy a new NFT contract - just a new Mint Account with supply = 1.</p>",
        "mintAddresses": "<h3><strong>NFTs Don't Have Contract Addresses, Only Mint Addresses</strong></h3><p>On Ethereum, each NFT collection is identified by its Contract Address, and each token has a unique tokenId within that contract. On Solana, each NFT is identified by a Mint Address. The difference is that you don't deploy a separate \"NFT contract\" - you just instruct the universal Token Program to create a new mint.</p><p>Because Solana's Token Program is universal, there's no concept of a unique \"NFT contract address.\" Instead, each NFT is a special SPL token (supply of 1) with its own Mint Address.</p><p>If you want a \"collection,\" you group multiple mint addresses together via a Collection Address in Metaplex, but each minted NFT is still just an SPL token with a unique Mint Address.</p>",
        "approvalFlow": "<h3><strong>No Approval Flow Needed</strong></h3><p>On Ethereum, ERC721 often relies on <code>approve</code> or <code>setApprovalForAll</code> for external marketplaces or dApps to transfer your NFTs. On Solana, each NFT is stored in a user's ATA(<a href=\"https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Associated token account</a>), and a single transaction can include any necessary steps. There's no separate approval flow - one atomic transaction can handle all instructions (e.g. transfer ownership, update metadata, etc.).</p>",
        "tokenProgramIntro": "<h3><strong>What Does A Solana Token Program Look Like?</strong></h3><p>A very rough translation of the Solana Token Program would look like this:</p>",
        "tokenProgramSummary": "<p>As you can see in the contract, instead of an approval flow, there is only a transfer function to move tokens. On Solana, a single transaction can call multiple smart contract functions atomically, removing the need for the approval flow. Another difference is that everything is stored in a token account on Solana, keeping the details of the owner's tokens separate from the other state.</p>",
        "metadata": "<h3><strong>Where's the NFT Metadata?</strong></h3><p>On Ethereum, ERC721 contracts often store a metadata URI or embed logic for fetching token metadata. On Solana, the Token Metadata Program (by Metaplex) handles NFT metadata in a separate account. You can include fields like name, symbol, description, image URI, and more--all without changing the underlying Token Program. This does mean there's a separate instruction in your minting transaction to attach metadata. Since Solana can handle multiple program calls atomically in one transaction, you can easily create the mint and set up metadata in a single go.</p>",
        "tradeoffs": "<h3><strong>Tradeoffs of Each Approach</strong></h3><p>Now that you have a general idea of how the token program and metadata program on Solana works, let's go through some of the tradeoffs of each NFT standard.</p><p><strong>ERC721</strong></p><ul><li>Highly customizable contracts</li><li>New contract deployment for each collection</li><li>Hard to index across many contracts</li><li>Metadata often defined in contract or via URIs</li><li>Requires individual audits</li></ul><p><strong>Solana NFT (SPL + Metaplex)</strong></p><ul><li>Single program for all NFTs</li><li>New NFTs created by transactions, not by new contracts</li><li>Easier to index since there's one main program</li><li>Metadata stored in a separate program</li><li>Reuses existing audited code</li></ul>",

The same PDA signer, token_account_owner_pda, is cached inside VaultState, letting the program act as custodian without ever exposing a private key. When a user calls deposit, the vault pulls their tokens in, mints proportional “shares,” and emits a DepositEvt, giving indexers an audit trail. The first depositor enjoys a 1 : 1 exchange rate, while later deposits use the classic supply × assets / totalAssets formula to keep shares aligned with vault value. Conversely, redeem burns the user’s shares, computes their slice of the pot, and ships the underlying tokens back out, firing a WithdrawEvt for good measure. Both CPI flows rely purely on token::transfer, mint_to, and burn, so Anchor’s safety checks guard every balance change. No yield strategy or fee logic is baked in; this snippet is the minimalist chassis you’d plug a strategy into. About ninety lines of Rust, yet it delivers the full “deposit, mint, withdraw, redeem” life‑cycle familiar to anyone who has integrated an ERC‑4626 vault on Ethereum."

        "<p>\n  In this article, we dive into the key differences between developing on\n  Ethereum and Solana, guiding you through how to build on Solana. Coming from\n  Ethereum, Solana will look and feel much different and have a diverse toolset\n  to use as you develop. This article will arm you with all the tools necessary\n  to build on Solana from an Ethereum background.\n</p>\n",
        "<h2>Account Model</h2><p>When developing on Solana, the most significant difference will run into is the account model design. It is helpful to understand why Solana’s account model was designed differently. Unlike Ethereum, Solana is designed to take advantage of the multiple cores in high-end machines. There is a trend in computing resources where the amount of available cores increases over time and becomes cheaper for people to purchase. Considering this, the account model is designed to leverage multiple cores, creating a system that parallelizes the transactions with each other. This parallelization creates further optimizations, such as local fee markets and faster throughput, which we will explore later.</p><p>So what is meant by the “account model”? On Solana, accounts are like objects containing some arbitrary data and specific rules for modification. Everything is an account on Solana, including smart contracts. Like Ethereum, each account has an address identifier to help locate an account. However, unlike Ethereum, where each smart contract is an account with the execution logic and storage tied together, Solana’s smart contracts are entirely stateless.</p><p>Smart contracts on Solana carry no state of their own and must have the state passed to them to execute on. To illustrate this, let’s take a look at two smart contracts for a counter, one in Solidity on Ethereum and one using Rust on Solana.</p>",
        "<p><strong>Ethereum Counter Smart Contract</strong></p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Solana Counter Program</strong></p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Node storing all data and participating in consensus</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ethereum:</strong> Archive Node</li><li><strong>Solana:</strong> [n/a]</li></ul><p><strong>Node storing some data and participating in consensus</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ethereum:</strong> Full Node</li><li><strong>Solana:</strong> Consensus Node</li></ul><p><strong>Node storing some data and not participating in consensus</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ethereum:</strong> Light Node</li><li><strong>Solana:</strong> RPC Node</li></ul>",
        "<p>While in Solidity, you have <code>int private count = 0;</code>, you have a struct within the Rust smart contract stating <code>initialize_counter</code>. This initial counter creates an account with a <code>count</code> of 0, which you then can pass this account to <code>increment</code> to add to the <code>count</code>. This is not to have state within the smart contract itself.</p><p>There are separate accounts that store the data outside of the program. To execute the logic in a program, you would pass the account you want to perform on. In the case of this <code>counter</code> program, you pass a <code>counter </code>account to the program when calling the<code> increment</code> function, and the program will increment the value in the <code>counter</code> account.</p>",
        "<h3>What are the benefits of the Solana Account Model?</h3><p>One of the most significant benefits of the Solana Account Model is program reusability.</p><p>Take ERC20 for example. ERC20 defines an interface specification on Ethereum for tokens. Every time someone wants to make a new token, the developer will have to redeploy the ERC20 smart contract onto Ethereum with its specified values, incurring the high cost of the redeployment.</p><p>Solana is different. You do not have to redeploy another smart contract onto the blockchain when creating new tokens. Instead, you create a new account, known as the mint account, off of the Solana Token Program, where the account defines a set of values to give the number of tokens in circulation, decimal points, who can mint more tokens, and who can freeze tokens.</p>",
        "<p>\n  You do not need to write any Rust or smart contracts to deploy a new token on\n  Solana. Send a transaction to the Token Program to create a new token in your\n  language of choice, and the token will then appear in your wallet. With the\n  Solana Program Library CLI, you can do this in a single command:\n</p>\n",
        "<h2>Local Fee Markets</h2><p>Another fortunate side effect of having the Solana account model is the ability to model fees based on state contention. As mentioned earlier, transactions can be executed in parallel. However, they are only executed in parallel based on what accounts are being written to. For example, let's say there is a popular NFT mint going on Solana. Typically, this popularity would increase the prices for everyone using the chain, but instead, everyone not participating in the NFT mint is unaffected.</p><p>As the name suggests, fee markets are local per account. If you're sending a transfer of USDC to someone while everyone else is minting the hottest new NFT, you will be unaffected and continue paying the low fee you're used to on Solana. This works with any application in Solana, avoiding the common global fee market you're used to on Ethereum while lowering everyone's cost.</p>",
        "<h3>How do fees work on Solana?</h3><p>Fees on Solana are broken up into a few categories: Base Fee, Priority Fee, and Rent.</p><p>The Base Fee can be calculated based on the number of signatures in a transaction. Each signature costs 5000 lamports (0.000000001&nbsp;<a href=\"https://solana.com/docs/terminology#sol\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sol</a> = 1 lamport). If your transaction requires 5 signatures, the base fee would be 25000 lamports. This base fee adds economic backpressure to the cluster's signature verification, which is one of the more compute-intensive actions. Half of the base fees are burnt, and half are rewarded to the validators.</p><p>The Priority Fee is an optional fee that anyone can add to a transaction to give priority over other transactions executing at the same time. Priority fee is measured based on the amount of compute units used in a transaction. Compute units are similar to Gas on Ethereum, a simple measurement of computing resources required for a transaction. Like Ethereum, the priority of your transaction is calculated based on the product of the compute unit price and the compute units used, or <code>priority fee = compute units * compute unit price</code>. Like base fees, half of priority fees are burnt, and half are rewarded to the validators.</p><p>The final fee, Rent, is more of a deposit than a fee. When you create accounts or allocate space on the network, you must deposit some SOL for the network to keep your account. Rent is calculated based on the number of bytes stored on the network, and an additional base fee is charged for allocating space. It is important to note that Rent fees are not lost; they can be collected if you close the account and allow the allocated space to be recollected by the cluster.</p>",
        "<h3>How do transactions work on Solana?</h3><p>With each fee being paid when executing a transaction, it is good to understand how transactions work. A transaction consists of three parts:</p><ul><li>one or more instructions</li><li>an array of accounts to read or write from</li><li>one or more signatures</li><li>recent blockhash or nonce</li></ul><p>An&nbsp;<a href=\"https://solana.com/docs/terminology#instruction\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">instruction</a>&nbsp;is the smallest execution logic on Solana. Instructions are a call to update the global Solana state. Instructions invoke programs that make calls to the Solana runtime to update the state (for example, calling the token program to transfer tokens from your account to another account). You can think of an instruction like a function call on an Ethereum smart contract.</p><p>A significant difference between Ethereum and Solana is the number of function calls in a single transaction due to the number of instructions. Having multiple instructions per transaction benefits developers as they do not have to create custom smart contracts to chain functions in a single transaction. Each instruction can be a separate function call, done in order in the transaction. Transactions are atomic, meaning if any of these instructions fails, the whole transaction will fail, and you will only pay the transaction fee. This is like failing a transaction due to not setting the correct slippage on Ethereum.</p><p>Another key difference to remember would be the use of a recent blockhash instead of an incremental nonce for transactions. When a wallet wants to make a transaction, a recent blockhash will be pulled from the cluster to create a valid transaction. This recent blockhash only makes the transaction valid for 150 blocks after the recent blockhash was retrieved. This prevents long-living transaction signatures from being executed at a much later date.</p>",
        "<h3>What are the limitations of transactions on Solana?</h3><p>Like Ethereum gas limitations, there are specific compute unit limitations on transactions for Solana. Each limitation can be found below:</p>",
        "<p>Solana has a <a href=\"https://solana.com/ru/docs/programs/limitations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">few additional caps</a> placed on transactions. Each account referenced may be at most 12,000,000 compute units used per block. This cap prevents people from write-locking a single account too many times in a single block, further preventing the local fee markets from being overrun by one account.</p><p>Another limit on transactions is the depth of instruction calls you can make in a single instruction. This limit is currently set to 4, meaning you can only call instructions at a depth of 4 before the transaction would revert. This makes re-entrancy issues nonexistent on Solana compared to something you’d have to worry about on Ethereum.</p>",
        "<h3>Where is the Mempool?</h3><p>Unlike Ethereum, Mempools don’t exist on Solana. Solana validators forward transactions to up to the following four leaders on the leader schedule. While Solana doesn’t have a mempool, it still has priority fees to help order transactions. Not having a mempool forces the transactions to hop from leader to leader until blockhash expiration, but it reduces the overhead of gossip communicating the mempool across the cluster.</p>",
        "<h3>Where can I find smart contract code?</h3><p>In the EVM world, most are familiar with finding smart contract code on Etherscan when viewing the smart contract address. However, viewing smart contract code on an explorer in the Solana ecosystem is relatively new and needs to be established compared to EVM standards. At the time of writing, <a href=\"http://Solana.fm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Solana.fm</a> is the only explorer that supports viewing smart contract code based on <a href=\"https://github.com/otter-sec/solana_verified_programs_api\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">verifiable builds</a>.</p><p>You can find the smart contract code by visiting a smart contract address the explorer. For example, going to the <a href=\"https://solana.fm/address/PhoeNiXZ8ByJGLkxNfZRnkUfjvmuYqLR89jjFHGqdXY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenix smart contract</a>, you can find the smart contract’s code <a href=\"https://solana.fm/address/PhoeNiXZ8ByJGLkxNfZRnkUfjvmuYqLR89jjFHGqdXY/verification\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">under the verification tab</a>. From here, you can analyze the code and understand if the smart contract is something you want to interact with.</p>",
        "<h2>What are the differences in the developer environment?</h2>\n",
        "<h3>Programming languages</h3><p>EVM primarily uses Solidity to write smart contracts, while Solana uses Rust. There is a framework called the <a href=\"https://www.anchor-lang.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Anchor framework</a> that allows you to build in Rust with many of the tools you are familiar with from EVM, but it is still Rust. If you want to stick with Solidity while building on Solana, a project named <a href=\"https://neonevm.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Neon</a> enables using Solidity. Neon comes with many of the tools you are familiar with, such as using Foundry or Hardhat during development. Using Neon may get you up and running faster, building on Solana, but you would need more composability outside of the Neon ecosystem with other Solana projects.</p><p>Like Ethereum, on the client side, you can find comparable SDKs for all your favorite programming languages on Solana.</p>",
        "<h3>Where are the tools I’m familiar with from EVM?</h3><p>As you migrate from EVM to building on Solana, you may be looking for the tools you are familiar with. Currently, the Solana ecosystem does not have tooling equal to Foundry but has a decent amount of other equivalents to the tools you are used to.</p>",
        "<p>With program derived addresses, you instead have to do the following:</p><p><strong>Client:</strong></p>",
        "<p><strong>Program:</strong></p>\n",
        "<p>The map's key is derived from the combination of the \"balance\" string and the signer's public key, while the program derived address provides the location to look up the map's value. Program derived addresses have more functionality than just providing a map; we can <a href=\"https://solanacookbook.com/core-concepts/pdas.html#facts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">learn about that later</a>.</p><p>In Solidity, the ability to upgrade your smart contracts using proxy contracts has become the norm. On Solana, programs are default upgradable without any special work involved. Each smart contract can be upgraded by a CLI command <code>solana program deploy &lt;program_filepath</code>. While programs are default upgradable, you can still demote their status to immutable with <code>solana program set-upgrade-authority &lt;program_address&gt; --final</code>. Once immutable, the program will be flagged as not upgradable on the explorers.</p>",
        "<p>A common thing you do when writing a solidity smart contract is check for either <code>msg.sender</code> or <code>tx.origin</code>. There isn't an equivalent on Solana because each transaction can have multiple signers. Also the person sending the transaction is not necessarily the one who signed the transaction because you have someone else pay for your transactions.</p><p>Let’s take a look at this basic Solana Program:</p>",
        "<p>\n  This will output a signer of the transaction as part of your program logs. As\n  mentioned before, you can have multiple signers:\n</p>\n",
        "<p><code>solana program deploy &lt;PROGRAM_FILEPATH&gt;</code></p> ",

        "<h2>How do I build my EVM project on Solana?</h2><p>Let’s take a simple project built in Solidity and go through the process of building the same project on Solana. A common first project you run into is a voting project. The Solidity smart contract would look like this:</p>",
        "<p><code>solana program deploy &lt;PROGRAM_FILEPATH&gt;</code></p> ",
        "<p>We quickly noticed a few things that were not available in Solana programs. View functions and <code>mapping</code> need to be done differently. Let’s start building this program on Solana!</p><p>Let’s create our very basic Solana program shell:</p>",
        "<p><code>solana program deploy &lt;PROGRAM_FILEPATH&gt;</code></p> ",
        "<p>We have two functions in our voting program, <code>init_candidate</code> and <code>vote_for_candidate</code>. The <code>init_candidate</code> function maps directly to our constructor in the Solidity smart contract, while <code>vote_for_candidate</code> maps one-to-one with voteForCandidate in Solidity.</p><p>One problem with <code>init_candidate</code> today is that it can be called by anyone permissionless, unlike the constructor in Solidity only being called by the contract deployer. To solve this, we will employ a similar feature to <code>onlyOwner </code>from Solidity. We set a specific address on the Solana program that is the only one that can execute the instruction.</p><p>Let’s say our publicKey is <code>8os8PKYmeVjU1mmwHZZNTEv5hpBXi5VvEKGzykduZAik</code>. By adding a reference to this publicKey in the Solana program and requiring the signer to match, we effectively emulate both <code>onlyOwner</code> and the constructor.</p>",
        "<p><code>solana program deploy &lt;PROGRAM_FILEPATH&gt;</code></p> ",
        "<p>We added an access control function <code>check</code> that will check if the signer of <code>init_candidate</code> matches the address listed in the smart contract. If the signer does not match, the <code>OnlyOwnerError </code>will be thrown, and the transaction will fail.</p><p>Let’s move on to the next bit in the Solidity smart contract, <code>candidateList </code>and <code>votesReceived</code>. While you can use a <code>Vec</code> in a Solana program similar to <code>bytes32[]</code>, managing the payments for changing the size can be a bit of a hassle. Instead, we will utilize Program Derived Addresses given specific candidate name, with the value found at that address being the <code>votesReceived </code>by the candidate.</p><p>To use Program Derived Accounts in a Solana Program, you use <code>seeds</code> and <code>bump</code> in the account. First, let’s create the account to track <code>votesReceived</code>.</p>",
        "<p><code>solana program deploy &lt;PROGRAM_FILEPATH&gt;</code></p> ",
        "<p><code>#[account]</code> denotes the struct as a Solana account, while the <code>#[derive(InitSpace)] </code>is a useful macro for auto-calculating the space required to allocate for <code>Candidate</code>. The<code> votes_received</code> can hold a count just like <code>votesReceived</code> in the Solidity smart contract.</p><p>Expanding the <code>InitializeCandidate</code> and <code>VoteCandidate</code>, we get the following:</p>",
        "<p><code>solana program deploy &lt;PROGRAM_FILEPATH&gt;</code></p> ",
        "<p>Wow, that’s a lot of new code in the accounts. Let’s unpack it.</p><p>First you’ll notice <code>#[instruction(_candidate_Name: String)]</code>. This means the context for <code>InitializeCandidate</code> expects a string <code>_candidate_name</code> to be passed into the instruction. We can see later this is used in <code>seeds = [_candidate_name.as_bytes().as_ref()]</code>. This means that the seed of the PDA will be <code>_candidate_Name</code>, and the value stored at the PDA will be the candidate’s <code>votes_received</code>.</p><p>Next you may have some questions on <code>space = 8 + Candidate::INIT_SPACE</code>. The <code>Candidate::INIT_SPACE</code> is how big the <code>Candidate</code> account is + <code>8</code>, <code>8</code> being the bytes added at the beginning of Anchor framework accounts for security checks. <code>pub system_program: Program&lt;'info, System&gt;</code>, is required when you’re creating an account, which is denoted by <code>init</code>. This means that any time an instruction using the <code>InitializeCandidate</code> context is called, the instruction will try to create a candidate account.</p><p>Now let’s add the business logic found in <code>voteForCandidate</code> from the Solidity smart contract.</p>",
        "<p><code>solana program deploy &lt;PROGRAM_FILEPATH&gt;</code></p> ",
        "<p>Here we take an additional parameter discussed earlier, <code>_candidate_name </code>. This will help match to the exact account we’re referencing for the candidate. We then increment the votes by 1 for that candidate.</p><p>That’s all we need to complete on the Solana program side, with the final Solana program looking like this:</p>",
        "<p><code>solana program deploy &lt;PROGRAM_FILEPATH&gt;</code></p> ",
        "<p>Now you might think, “But wait, what about <code>totalVotesFor</code> and <code>validCandidate</code> from the Solidity smart contract?” <code>validCandidate</code> is already accounted for because <code>vote_for_candidate</code> will fail if you pass an account that does not exist. <code>totalVotesFor</code> can be done client-side with Typescript and does not need to exist within the Solana program.</p><p>Now that we’ve built the Solana program, let’s interact with it.</p><p>Loading the program into <a href=\"https://beta.solpg.io/65dc240ccffcf4b13384cf71\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Solana Playground</a>, I can build and deploy it to Devnet. Once you build and deploy the program, you’ll find that you can run tests with the instructions on the test tab.</p>",
        "<p>This is akin to using Remix to test your Solidity smart contract. Opening up <code>initCandidate</code> and entering the name <code>John Smith</code> as the candidate name, we now have to generate the PDA for <code>John Smith</code>. Click on the candidate account finder and select <code>From seed</code>. Select the custom String and input <code>John Smith</code>, and finally click <code>generate</code>. Congratulations, you just found your PDA for <code>John Smith</code>! Now hit <code>Test</code> to execute the instruction.</p><p>If all is successful, you should see the following program logs on the test transaction.</p>",
        "<p>\n  Now let’s vote for <code>John Smith </code>! Opening up the\n  <code>voteForCandidate</code> instruction, type in <code>John Smith</code> and\n  generate the same PDA again. Hit <code>Test</code> to vote for your first\n  candidate!\n</p>\n",
        "<p>\n  Now that you’ve voted, how can you check how many votes the candidate has?\n  Head on over to <code>Candidate</code> under <code>Accounts</code> on the test\n  tab and hit the button <code>Fetch All</code>. This will grab all valid\n  candidates and their votes. From there you’ll receive an array of the\n  candidates, their account addresses, and their votes.\n</p>\n",
        "<p>\n  Congratulations! You just took the voting Solidity smart contract and\n  translated into a Solana program. You can use a lot of the same techniques on\n  other Solidity smart contracts to build what you have on EVM on Solana.

        "<h3>What’s different with smart contract development?</h3><p>There are several things to take note of when you are building programs on Solana or migrating your Ethereum smart contract over.</p><p>For example, if you are looking for mapping like you are used to using on Ethereum smart contracts, this type does not directly exist on Solana. Instead, you use program-derived addresses, or PDA for short. Like mapping, program-derived addresses can give you the ability to create a map from a key or account to a value stored on-chain. The way you map is different from that of Ethereum.</p><p>Let’s say you want to map user accounts to their balance on-chain. In Solidity, you do something like the following:</p>"
