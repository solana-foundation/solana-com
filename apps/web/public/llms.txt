# Solana

> Solana is the high-performance blockchain designed for mass adoption, capable of processing thousands of transactions per second with sub-second finality. This documentation provides comprehensive guides, references, and tutorials for developers building scalable blockchain applications on Solana.

Solana uses a unique Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus combined with Proof-of-Stake to achieve high throughput without sacrificing decentralization. Key concepts include:

- **Accounts**: All data on Solana is stored in accounts—the fundamental storage primitive
- **Transactions**: Atomic bundles of instructions that modify on-chain state
- **Programs**: Smart contracts deployed to the Solana runtime (written in Rust or using frameworks like Anchor)
- **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**: Deterministic addresses controlled by programs for storing data
- **Cross-Program Invocation (CPI)**: Mechanism for programs to call other programs
