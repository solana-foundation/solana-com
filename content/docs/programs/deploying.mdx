title: "Deploying Programs"
description:
  Uploading custom programs to the Solana blockchain using the Solana CLI.
---

This guide assumes knowledge of the following topics:
- [Solana account model](/core/accounts)
- [Solana programs in general](/core/programs)
- [Developing custom Solana programs](/programs/rust/)

## Loader-v3 and Loader-v4
There is currently an ongoing transition from loader-v3 (program subcommand) to
loader-v4 (program **-v4** subcommand) as loader-v3 is being deprecated.

For new deployments please use `solana program-v4 deploy` instead of
`solana program deploy`.

To migrate an existing program (which is essentially redeploying it):
```shell
solana program migrate ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json
```

## Preparation
First, the program needs to be build (compiled, linked, stripped).
```shell
cargo +solana build --target sbpf-solana-solana --release
```
This step must be performed before every re-/deployment.

Check that sufficient funds are available to the default payer account
proportional to the size of the executable:
```shell
du -h ./target/deploy/your_program.so 
solana balance
```

Additionally, each program has a program account and a program ID,
which is the address of that program account. The following generates a keypair
for the program account:
```shell
solana-keygen new -o ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json
```
This must only be performed once per program and will be reused for
redeployments of the same program later on.

The toolchain contained a short cut,
it is however being phased out / deprecated:
```shell
cargo-build-sbf
```

## Initial Deployment
Now the executable can be uploaded to the program account:

### Loader-v3
The parameter is called `program-id` even though it expects the file-path of a keypair:
```shell
solana program deploy ./target/deploy/your_program.so --program-id ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json
```

### Loader-v4
```shell
solana program-v4 deploy ./target/deploy/your_program.so --program-keypair ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json
```

## Redeployment
Uploading a different executable to the same program account again will
overwrite / replace it. However, for redeployments, only the program ID (pubkey
of the program keypair) is needed, not the entire keypair, because the signer
is the upgrade authority keypair instead.

### Loader-v3
This is exactly the same as the initial deployment:
```shell
solana program deploy ./target/deploy/your_program.so --program-id ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json
```

If the old executable was shorter than the new one it might be necessary to
grow the programdata account first:
```shell
solana program extend ./target/deploy/your_program.so <ADDITIONAL_BYTES>
```

### Loader-v4
Notice the initial deployment used `program-keypair`, while the redeployment
uses `program-id` instead:
```shell
solana program-v4 deploy ./target/deploy/your_program.so --program-id ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json
```

## Prioritizing an Upload
During times of congestion, there are a few additional flags you can use to help
with program deployment:

- `--with-compute-unit-price`: Set compute unit price for transaction, in
  increments of 0.000001 lamports (micro-lamports) per compute unit.
  Use the
  [Priority Fee API by Helius](https://docs.helius.dev/guides/priority-fee-api)
  to get an estimate of the priority fee to set.
- `--use-rpc`: Send write transactions to the configured RPC instead of
  validator TPUs. This flag requires a
  [stake-weighted](/developers/guides/advanced/stake-weighted-qos) RPC
  connection such as [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/) or
  [Triton](https://triton.one/). This flag can also be configured to be
  default using: `solana config set --url <RPC_URL>`.
- `--max-sign-attempts`: Maximum number of attempts to sign or resign
  transactions after blockhash expiration. If any transactions sent during the
  program deploy are still unconfirmed after the initially chosen recent
  blockhash expires, those transactions will be resigned with a new recent
  blockhash and resent. Use this setting to adjust the maximum number of
  transaction signing iterations. Each blockhash is valid for about 60 seconds,
  which means using the default value of 5 will lead to sending transactions for
  at least 5 minutes or until all transactions are confirmed, whichever comes
  first.

## Resuming an Upload
It is possible that an upload gets stuck or is aborted.

### Loader-v3
If program deployment fails, there will be a hanging intermediate buffer account
that contains a non-zero balance. In order to recoup that balance you may resume
a failed deployment by providing the same intermediate buffer to a new call to
`deploy`.

Deployment failures will print an error message specifying the seed phrase
needed to recover the generated intermediate buffer's keypair:

```
==================================================================================
Recover the intermediate account's ephemeral keypair file with
`solana-keygen recover` and the following 12-word seed phrase:
==================================================================================
valley flat great hockey share token excess clever benefit traffic avocado athlete
==================================================================================
To resume a deploy, pass the recovered keypair as
the [BUFFER_SIGNER] to `solana program deploy` or `solana program write-buffer'.
Or to recover the account's lamports, pass it as the
[BUFFER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS] argument to `solana program drain`.
==================================================================================
```

To recover the keypair:
```shell
solana-keygen recover -o ./target/deploy/buffer-keypair.json
```
When asked, enter the 12-word seed phrase.

Then issue a new `deploy` command and specify the buffer:
```shell
solana program deploy ./target/deploy/your_program.so --program-id ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json --buffer ./target/deploy/buffer-keypair.json
```

### Loader-v4
It is possible to resume an upload at a specified byte offset:
```shell
solana program deploy ./target/deploy/your_program.so --program-id ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json --start-offset <BYTES_UPLOADED_SO_FAR>
```

## Finalization
This is an **irreversible** action.

A program can be made immutable by removing its upgrade authority.

### Loader-v3
```shell
solana program set-upgrade-authority ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json --final
```

### Loader-v4
```shell
solana program finalize --program-id ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json
```

Instead of overwriting programs it is also possible to provide users the choice
of which version of a program they want to use by constructing a linked list of
finalized programs:
```shell
solana program finalize --program-id ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json --next-version ../your_newer_program/target/deploy/your_newer_program-keypair.json
```

## Closing
For programs deployed under loader-v3 only their programdata account, the
buffer accounts and the funds locked in those can be reclaimed. The program
account together with the program ID and funds locked in the program account
specifically are stuck.

Programs deployed under loader-v4 can be closed with their program account,
their program ID and their locked funds all becoming available for other uses
again.

### Loader-v3
This is an **irreversible** action for programs deployed using loader-v3.

Note that once a program is closed, its program ID cannot be reused. Attempting
to deploy a program with a previously closed program ID will result in an error.
If you need to redeploy a program after closing it, you must generate a new
program keypair file.

To close a single programdata account:
```shell
solana program close ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json
```

To close all the buffer accounts associated with the current authority:
```shell
solana program close --buffers
```

### Loader-v4
```shell
solana program-v4 close --program-id ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json
```

## Inspecting Metadata
The `show` subcommand lists the metadata of a program.

An example output looks like:
```shell
Program Id: 3KS2k14CmtnuVv2fvYcvdrNgC94Y11WETBpMUGgXyWZL
Owner: BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e11111111111111111111111
ProgramData Address: EHsACWBhgmw8iq5dmUZzTA1esRqcTognhKNHUkPi4q4g
Authority: FwoGJNUaJN2zfVEex9BB11Dqb3NJKy3e9oY3KTh9XzCU
Last Deployed In Slot: 63890568
Data Length: 5216 (0x1460) bytes
```

- `Program Id` is the address that can be referenced in an instruction's
  `program_id` field when invoking a program.
- `Owner`: The loader this program was deployed with.
- `ProgramData Address` is the programdata account associated with the program
  account that holds the program's executable (loader-v3 only).
- `Status`: `retracted`, `deployed` or `finalized` (loader-v4 only).
- `Authority` is the program's upgrade authority.
- `Last Deployed In Slot` is the slot in which the program was last deployed.
- `Data Length` is the size of the space reserved for deployments. The actual
  space used by the currently deployed program may be less.

### Loader-v3
To view a specific program:
```shell
solana program show ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json
```

To view the list of programs deployed with the default authority:
```shell
solana program show --programs
```

To show all buffer accounts regardless of the authority:
```shell
solana program show --buffers --all
```

To specify a different authority:
```shell
solana program show --programs --buffer-authority ~/.config/solana/authority-keypair.json
solana program show --buffers --buffer-authority ~/.config/solana/authority-keypair.json
```

### Loader-v4
To view a specific program:
```shell
solana program-v4 show --program-id ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json
```

To view the list of programs deployed with the default authority:
```shell
solana program-v4 show --all
```

To view the list of programs deployed with a specific authority:
```shell
solana program-v4 show --authority ~/.config/solana/authority-keypair.json
```

## Downloading the Executable
Sometimes it is useful to download and compare a program to ensure it contains
a known executable. The downloaded file can be truncated, hashed, and compared
to the hash of the original program file.

### Loader-v3
```shell
solana program dump ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json ./target/deploy/your_program.so
```

### Loader-v4
```shell
solana program download ./target/deploy/your_program.so --program-id ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json
```

## Advanced: Authority Transfer
The right to change a given program lies with its authority. This authority can
be transferred to another keypair without changing the program keypair, so that
the program ID stays the same. Furthermore, a single authority can control
multiple program accounts.

If not explicitly specified during the initial deployment, then the default
keypair is used as authority. This is why redeploying a program in the steps
above didn't require an authority to be explicitly specified.

An explicit authority is useful for offline signing and multi-entity governed
programs.

First, a keypair for the authority must be generated:
```shell
solana-keygen new -o ~/.config/solana/authority-keypair.json
```

### Loader-v3
The authority can be specified during deployment:
```shell
solana program deploy ./target/deploy/your_program.so --upgrade-authority ~/.config/solana/authority-keypair.json
```

Or after deployment and using the default keypair as the current authority:
```shell
solana program set-upgrade-authority ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json --new-upgrade-authority ~/.config/solana/authority-keypair.json
```

Or after deployment and specifying the current authority:
```shell
solana program set-upgrade-authority ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json --upgrade-authority ~/.config/solana/authority-keypair.json --new-upgrade-authority ~/.config/solana/new_authority-keypair.json
```

### Loader-v4
The authority can be specified during deployment:
```shell
solana program-v4 deploy ./target/deploy/your_program.so --program-keypair ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json --authority ~/.config/solana/authority-keypair.json
```

Or after deployment and using the default keypair as the current authority:
```shell
solana program-v4 transfer-authority --program-id ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json --new-authority ~/.config/solana/authority-keypair.json
```

Or after deployment and specifying the current authority:
```shell
solana program-v4 transfer-authority --program-id ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json --authority ~/.config/solana/authority-keypair.json --new-authority ~/.config/solana/new_authority-keypair.json
```

## Advanced: Two-Step Redeployment using a Buffer
Instead of uploading directly to the program account, the executable can be
uploaded to a staging buffer account first and then be transferred to the
program account in a second step (the actual re-/deployment). This is useful
for offline signing and multi-entity governed programs such as a DAO voting
to choose or reject an uploaded executable before the actual redeployment.

Keep in mind that using buffer accounts roughly doubles the funds required
during the upload process because two accounts are holding one executable
each, simultaneously.

First, a keypair for the buffer account must be created:
```shell
solana-keygen new -o ~/.config/solana/buffer-keypair.json
```
The buffer account can be reused for different uploads and is not bound to
any specific program account.

### Loader-v3
```shell
solana program write-buffer ./target/deploy/your_program.so --buffer ~/.config/solana/buffer-keypair.json
solana program deploy --program-id ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json --buffer ~/.config/solana/buffer-keypair.json
```

### Loader-v4
```shell
solana program-v4 deploy ./target/deploy/your_program.so --buffer ~/.config/solana/buffer-keypair.json
solana program-v4 deploy --program-id ./target/deploy/your_program-keypair.json --buffer ~/.config/solana/buffer-keypair.json
```

## Advanced: Offline Signing
Some security models require separating the signing process from the
transaction broadcast, such that the signing keys can be completely
disconnected from any network, also known as offline signing.

Note that only the redeployments can be performed in offline mode.
The initial program deployment **must** be performed from an online machine,
and only subsequent program redeployments can leverage offline signing.

A typical setup would consist of two different signers:
- online signer (fee payer and authority of the buffer account)
- offline signer (authority of the program account)

The general process is a two-step redeployment with some extras:
1. (online) create a new program
2. (online) transfer the authority to the offline signer
3. (online) create buffer and upload an executable to it
4. (optional) verify the buffer's on-chain contents
5. (offline) sign a transaction to redeploy the program using the buffer
`--blockhash <VALUE> --sign-only`
6. (online) use this signature to broadcast the redeployment transaction
`--blockhash <VALUE> --signer <OFFLINE_SIGNER_PUBKEY>:<OFFLINE_SIGNER_SIGNATURE>`

Look up a recent `blockhash` and paste it in to generate the offline
transaction signature. The `blockhash` expires after ~60 seconds. If you didn't
make it in time - just get another fresh hash and repeat until you succeed, or
consider using durable transaction nonces.
