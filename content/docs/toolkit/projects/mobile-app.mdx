> This is a beta version of the [Solana Toolkit](/docs/toolkit/), and is
> still a WIP. Please post all feedback as a GitHub issue
> [here](https://github.com/solana-foundation/developer-content/issues/new?title=%5Btoolkit%5D%20).

```shell
yarn create expo-app --template @solana-mobile/solana-mobile-expo-template
```

## Overview

This will initialize a new project using the [Expo](https://expo.dev) framework
that is specifically designed for creating mobile applications that interact
with the Solana blockchain.

Follow this template's guide for
"[Running the app](https://docs.solanamobile.com/react-native/expo#running-the-app)"
in order to launch the template as a custom development build and get it running
on your Android emulator. Once you have built the program and are running a dev
client with Expo, the emulator will automatically update every time you save
your code.

## Prerequisites

To use this template, you will also need to set up the following:

- [Android Studio and Emulator](https://docs.solanamobile.com/getting-started/development-setup)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?platform=android)
- [EAS CLI and Account](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/)
