> This is a beta version of the [Solana Toolkit](/docs/toolkit/), and is
> still a WIP. Please post all feedback as a GitHub issue
> [here](https://github.com/solana-foundation/developer-content/issues/new?title=%5Btoolkit%5D%20).

```shell
mucho coverage
```

## Overview

This command will run a code coverage test on all of your Rust tests and then
generates a report as an HTML page providing metrics on where additional tests
may be needed to improve your current code coverage.

> Currently, this tool only works on tests written in Rust and is not compatible
> with a JavaScript test suite.
