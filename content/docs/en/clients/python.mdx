## Solana Python SDK
There are two packages that are useful for developing with Python:

[`@kevinheavy/solana.py`](https://github.com/michaelhly/solana-py)
- Solana.py is the base Python library for interacting with Solana.
- You can use it to build transactions and interact with the [Solana JSON RPC API](https://docs.solana.com/apps/jsonrpc-api), much like you would do with [solana-web3.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/)

- It also covers the [SPL Token Program](https://spl.solana.com/token).

- [Latest Documentation](https://michaelhly.github.io/solana-py/).

[`@kevinheavey/solders`](https://github.com/kevinheavey/solders)
- `solders` is a high-performance Python toolkit for Solana, written in Rust. It provides robust solutions to the following problems:

- Core SDK stuff: keypairs, pubkeys, signing and serializing transactions - that sort of thing.
- RPC stuff: building requests and parsing responses (no networking stuff - if you want help with that, 
[solana-py](https://michaelhly.github.io/solana-py/rpc/async_api/) is your friend).
- Integration testing stuff: the `solders.litesvm` module is an alternative to `solana-test-validator` that's much more convenient and **much** faster. It's based on [solana-program-test](https://crates.io/crates/solana-program-test) if you know that is.


## Solana Client Python SDK

If you want to interact with Solana contracts with Python, you can use clients SDK to render Solana rust contracts to Python clients, if only you can get the IDL file of the contract. 

[`Codama-py`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/codama-py)
- Standardize any Solana on-chain contract program to [`Codama IDL`](https://github.com/codama-idl/codama) and generate an interactive Python client. 
- Supports both Anchor and custom programs.

[`Anchor-py`](https://github.com/kevinheavey/anchorpy)
- Anchor-py is a Python client for Anchor programs. It can generate clients from Anchor IDL files, and interact with Anchor programs.



## Writing Solana Programs in Python

[`Seahorse`](https://www.seahorse.dev/) 

- Writing Solana on-chain contracts in Python
- How it works: AST -> Rust -> Anchor -> Deployment
- Use `rustpython`(https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython) to parse Python source code into an intermediate abstract syntax tree
- Limitations: Some Python capabilities are not easily implemented in Rust (e.g, static vs. dynamic typing), so we don't suggest using Seahorse for complex logic.

## Solana Python Cookbook

[`Solana Python Cookbook`](https://solana.com/zh/developers/cookbook)
