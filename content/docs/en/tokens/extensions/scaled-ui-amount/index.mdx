## What is the Scaled UI Amount extension?

The scaled UI amount extension allows issuers to apply an updatable multiplier
to the UI amount of a token. This is useful for scenarios where the token is
used to represent a real-world asset, such as a stock or dividend.

For example, a stock split doubles the number of shares for all holders. Without
this extension, it is currently impractical to mint new tokens to all holders
during a split event in an efficient and scalable way.

With the Token-2022 extension model, however, we have the possibility to change
how the UI amount of tokens are represented. Using the ScaledUiAmount extension
and the `amount_to_ui_amount` instruction, you can set a UI multiplier on your
token and fetch its UI amount at any time.
[source code](https://github.com/solana-program/token-2022/tree/main/program/src/extension/scaled_ui_amount).

This feature can also be used for dividends or distributing yield.

Note: No new tokens are ever created, the UI amount returns the raw amount of
tokens multiplied by the current multiplier. The feature is entirely cosmetic.

<Callout type="info">
  Some extensions are incompatible with each other and you can't enable them
  simultaneously on the same token mint or token account. You should not enable
  both the `ScaledUiAmount` extension and the `InterestBearingMint` extension on the same
  token mint or token account.
