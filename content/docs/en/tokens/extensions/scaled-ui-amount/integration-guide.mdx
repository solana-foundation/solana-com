# Supporting Scaled UI Amount Extension on Solana

## Background

The Scaled UI Amount extension allows token issuers to specify a multiplier to
be used when calculating the UI amount of a user’s token balance. This enables
issuers to create rebasing tokens and to enable things like stock splits. This
extension, like the interest bearing token extension, provides a purely cosmetic
UI amount which means teams need to do some additional work to provide a good
experience. Underlying calculations and transfers all occur using the raw
amounts in the program.

### Resources:

- [Developer Documentation](https://www.solana-program.com/docs/token-2022/extensions#scaled-ui-amount)
- [Extension Rust Code](https://github.com/solana-program/token-2022/tree/main/program/src/extension/scaled_ui_amount)
- [Amount to UI Amount Rust Code](https://github.com/solana-program/token-2022/blob/main/program/src/processor.rs#L1425)

## TL;DR

- End users should interact with the UIAmount (raw amount \* multiplier) for the
  token price, token balance, and token amounts whenever possible
- dApps and service providers should use the raw amount and non-scaled prices
  for all calculations and convert for users at the edge
- Historical price feeds need to be provided for both scaled and non-scaled
  amounts for easier integration
- Historical multiplier values need to be accessible for accurate historical
  data

## Terms Definitions

- Multiplier: static updatable multiplier that’s used for UI Amount calculations
- UIAmount: multiplier \* raw amount (AKA: scaled amount)
- Raw Amount: amount (AKA: non-scaled amount)

## Current Balance

### Current Amount for Display

- Anytime you display amounts for tokens that use the scaled UI amount extension
  to end users you should use either:
  - UIAmount/UIAmountString (**_preferred_**)
  - A manual calculation of raw amount \* multiplier
  - We recommend truncating this value based on the number of decimals the token
    has.
    - Ex: if yUSD has 6 decimals and a user has a UIAmount of 1.123456789 you
      should display “1.123456”

### Where to get this data:

- For a user’s live balance you can get updated information on the above amounts
  by calling either getTokenAccountBalance or getAccountInfo
- If you need to know the UI Amount for an arbitrary amount you can get this
  calculation by calling the
  [`amountToUiAmountForMintWithoutSimulation`](https://github.com/solana-program/token-2022/blob/main/clients/js-legacy/src/actions/amountToUiAmount.ts#L164)
  (web3.js v1) function or simulating a transaction using amountToUiAmount.
  - Note: amountToUiAmount requires a transaction simulation which means it also
    needs a valid fee payer with balance. Because of this, this should not be
    the default way to get a balance.

### Updating the Current Amount

Because Issuers can update the multiplier at any given time you can consider
occasionally polling in order to keep the account balance updated. Issuers are
unlikely to update this multiplier more than once per day. If a multiplier is
set for a future date, you can automatically poll at this update time

## Token Amounts in Transactions (transfers / swaps etc)

- Users should enter amounts to be interpreted as the scaled “UIAmount”. The app
  that has to process this should convert to the raw token amount for the
  transaction.
  - If there are rounding issues, round down and prefer leaving a tiny amount of
    dust rather than risk the transaction failing
  - To do this conversion you can use the
    [`uiAmountToAmountForMintWithoutSimulation`](https://github.com/solana-program/token-2022/blob/main/clients/js-legacy/src/actions/amountToUiAmount.ts#L312C23-L312C63)
    (web3.js v1) function or simulating a transaction using amountToUiAmount.
- Apps should use the total raw amount when a user requests to do an action with
  “max” or “all” of their balance. This ensures that there is no dust left over.
  - Optional: You can consider automatically closing an account when “max” is
    used to refund the user of their storage deposit

## Token Price

- Token price should always be displayed as the scaled price wherever possible.
- If you are a price feed service provider, such as an oracle, you should expose
  both the scaled and non-scaled price.
  - Wherever possible provide an SDK/API that abstracts the scaled UI amount
    extension complexities away.

## Current Multiplier

- The current multiplier can be read from the token mint at any time by calling
  `getAccountInfo`. Additionally, if a future multiplier is set, this
  information is also available from the token mint. We recommend not showing
  this multiplier as it can confuse the UX.

## Historical Data

### Historical Data for Price Feed

- Services who provide historical data should store and **surface both the
  scaled and non-scaled prices for the scaled UI amount extension**.
- We expect scaled amounts to be used most frequently as this aligns with how
  the traditional finance world treats charts related to tokens with stock
  splits.

### Historical Data for Amounts

- If you would like to show the balance transferred in the past you need access
  to the multiplier at that given slot. You can also save the UiAmount for
  transfers as you process transactions to avoid doing this calculation in the
  future.

## Backwards Compatibility

- By default wallets and applications that do not understand the scaled UI
  amount extension will show the correct total price of an activity by
  multiplying the non-scaled price \* raw amount.
- They would, however, display the non-scaled price causing some user confusion.
- We hope this encourages teams to update their dapps to be compatible with
  tokens that use the scaled UI amount extension and are happy to provide
  support during this process.
