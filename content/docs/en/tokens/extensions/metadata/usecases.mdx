## Challenge 1: The Credential Verification Crisis

### The Problem

In January 2023, [federal agents dismantled a $100 million nursing diploma scheme](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdfl/pr/fraudulent-nursing-diploma-scheme-leads-federal-charges-against-25-defendants) that sold fake credentials to thousands of people. Hospitals unknowingly hired unqualified individuals, putting patient safety at risk. The fundamental issue: no reliable way to verify educational credentials in real-time.

**Current systems rely on:**
- Phone calls to schools (slow, unreliable)
- PDF certificates (easily forged)  
- Third-party databases (expensive, often outdated)
- Manual verification processes (error-prone)

### Your Mission

Build a credential verification system with Token 2022 metadata extensions.

**What it needs to do:**
- Schools mint credential tokens
- Credentials store degree/certification details in metadata
- Employers verify credentials without calling schools
- Credentials can be updated for continuing education
- No way to forge credentials

### Technical Implementation Hints

**Metadata Structure Design:**
```
- Institution Name & ID
- Student Name & ID  
- Degree/Certification Type
- Completion Date
- GPA/Honors
- Accreditation Body
- Verification URL
- Digital Signature Hash
```

**Questions to Solve:**
1. How would you structure the [metadata fields](./how-extensions-work#tlv-type-length-value-encoding) to store institution verification data?
2. Which [implementation approach](./typescript) would you use for the institutional minting interface?
3. How would you handle [metadata updates](./anchor#step-5-additional-fields-update) for continuing education credits?
4. What [account validation](./native-rust#step-6-custom-error-types) would prevent unauthorized credential minting?

**Extra Credit:**
- Joint degrees from multiple schools
- Expiring certifications that update automatically
- Hide grades but show degree completion
- Connect to existing student databases

## Challenge 2: Supply Chain Authenticity

### The Problem

[U.S. Customs seized $2.7 billion in counterfeit goods in 2023](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/trade). Despite anti-counterfeiting measures, luxury brands like [Louis Vuitton are frequently counterfeited](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/almost-half-million-counterfeit-louis-vuitton-belts-seized-ky). The core issue: no single source of truth that travels with the product throughout its lifecycle.

**Current problems:**
- Serial numbers can be duplicated
- Certificates of authenticity are forgeable  
- No way to track ownership history
- Expensive third-party authentication services
- No real-time verification at point of sale

### Your Mission

Build a product authenticity system with Token 2022 metadata extensions.

**What it needs to do:**
- Manufacturers mint tokens for physical products
- Metadata stores manufacturing details, materials, history
- Ownership transfers are tracked
- Anyone can verify authenticity instantly
- Updates for repairs, certifications, recalls

### Technical Implementation Hints

**Metadata Structure Design:**
```
- Manufacturer Details
- Product Specifications
- Serial Number/SKU
- Manufacturing Date & Location
- Materials Composition
- Quality Certifications
- Ownership History
- Service Records
```

**Questions to Solve:**
1. How would you design [TLV data structures](./how-extensions-work#tlv-type-length-value-encoding) for complex product specifications?
2. Which [space calculations](./how-extensions-work#space-calculation-formula) would accommodate variable-length warranty information?
3. How would you implement [metadata updates](./typescript#step-4-updating-additional-metadata-fields) for service records and repairs?
4. What [account reallocation](./how-extensions-work#account-reallocation) strategy handles growing ownership histories?

**Extra Credit:**
- Track carbon footprint through entire supply chain
- Handle products with thousands of components
- Automatic recall notifications
- Connect to insurance systems

## Challenge 3: Digital Asset Authenticity

### The Problem

The [March 2022 Ronin Bridge hack drained $625 million from Axie Infinity](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/29/axie-infinitys-ronin-network-suffers-625m-exploit), making players' digital assets worthless overnight. The issue wasn't duplicationâ€”it was infrastructure compromise. Players lost trust because they couldn't verify what was authentic in the collapsed ecosystem.

**Current problems:**
- Off-chain metadata can disappear
- No verifiable creation history
- Centralized services create single points of failure
- No way to prove rarity or authenticity independently
- Metadata updates require centralized control

### Your Mission

Build a gaming asset system with Token 2022 metadata extensions.

**What it needs to do:**
- Game devs mint tokens for in-game assets
- All metadata stored on-chain
- Players can prove ownership without the game company
- Assets keep value even if servers shut down
- Assets work across different games

### Technical Implementation Hints

**Metadata Structure Design:**
```
- Asset Type & Category
- Rarity Level & Statistics
- Creation Block/Timestamp
- Original Creator/Artist
- Game Integration Data
- Visual/Audio Asset Hashes
- Gameplay Mechanics Data
- Trading History
```

**Questions to Solve:**
1. How would you structure [metadata initialization](./how-extensions-work#the-initialization-order-that-matters) for complex gaming assets?
2. Which [client implementation](./typescript#step-2-the-complete-implementation) would handle real-time gameplay integration?
3. How would you design [update mechanisms](./anchor#step-4-basic-metadata-initialization) for evolving asset statistics?
4. What [error handling](./native-rust#step-5-custom-error-types) prevents unauthorized asset modifications?

**Extra Credit:**
- Move assets between different blockchains
- Generate assets with provably fair algorithms
- Assets that level up and evolve
- Connect to Unity or Unreal Engine

## Challenge 4: Financial Compliance & Reporting

### The Problem

Traditional financial systems struggle with real-time compliance reporting and audit trails. Regulators require detailed information about financial instruments, but current systems rely on batch processing, manual reporting, and fragmented data sources that can't provide real-time visibility.

**Current problems:**
- Compliance data scattered across multiple systems
- Manual regulatory reporting (slow, error-prone)
- No real-time audit capabilities
- Difficulty tracking instrument lifecycle
- Complex reconciliation processes

### Your Mission

Build a financial compliance system with Token 2022 metadata extensions.

**What it needs to do:**
- Banks mint tokens for financial instruments (bonds, loans, derivatives)
- Metadata contains all regulatory information
- Real-time compliance monitoring
- Complete audit trails
- Automated regulatory reports

### Technical Implementation Hints

**Metadata Structure Design:**
```
- Instrument Classification
- Regulatory Jurisdiction
- Risk Ratings & Categories
- Counterparty Information
- Maturity & Terms
- Compliance Status
- Audit Trail References
- Regulatory Filings
```

**Questions to Solve:**
1. How would you handle [large metadata structures](./how-extensions-work#space-calculation-formula) for complex financial instruments?
2. Which [implementation approach](./native-rust) provides the control needed for financial regulations?
3. How would you design [metadata updates](./anchor#step-5-additional-fields-update) for changing regulatory requirements?
4. What [validation mechanisms](./native-rust#step-6-custom-error-types) ensure compliance data integrity?

**Extra Credit:**
- Handle different regulations across countries
- Calculate and report risk in real-time
- Connect to existing bank systems
- Keep sensitive data private while staying compliant

- It handles edge cases
- It scales to real usage
- Others can build on it

### The Real Test

Would someone trust your system with something valuable? Would a hospital use your credential checker? Would luxury brands use your authenticity system? Would gamers trust your asset platform?

That's what matters.
