  and Mac.
---

This section covers the steps to set up your local environment for Solana
development.

## Quick Installation

On Mac and Linux, run this single command to install all dependencies.

```terminal
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://solana-install.solana.workers.dev | bash
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Windows users: you must first install WSL (see [Install
  Dependencies](#install-dependencies)). Then run the preceding command in the
  Ubuntu (Linux) terminal.
</Callout>

After installation, you should see output like the following:

```
Installed Versions:
Rust: rustc 1.86.0 (05f9846f8 2025-03-31)
Solana CLI: solana-cli 2.2.12 (src:0315eb6a; feat:1522022101, client:Agave)
Anchor CLI: anchor-cli 0.31.1
Node.js: v23.11.0
Yarn: 1.22.1
```

<Callout>

If the quick installation command doesn't work, please refer to the
[Install Dependencies](#install-dependencies) section below for instructions to
install each dependency individually.

If the quick install command runs successfully, skip to the
[Solana CLI Basics](#solana-cli-basics) and
[Anchor CLI Basics](#anchor-cli-basics) sections below.

</Callout>

## Install Dependencies

The instructions below guides you through installing each dependency
individually.

- Windows users must first install WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux) and then
  install the dependencies specified in the Linux section below.
- Linux users should first install the dependencies specified in the Linux
  section below.
- Mac users should start with the Rust installation instructions below.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)">

To develop Solana programs on Windows **you must use
[WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)** (Windows
subsystem for Linux). Install all other dependencies through the Linux terminal.

After installing WSL, install the dependencies specified in the Linux section
below before proceeding to install Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor CLI.

To install WSL, run the following command in Windows PowerShell:

```terminal
$ wsl --install
```

The install process prompts you to create a default user account.

![WSL Install](/assets/docs/intro/installation/wsl-install.png)

By default, WSL installs Ubuntu. You can open a Linux terminal by searching
"Ubuntu" in the Search bar.

![WSL Ubuntu](/assets/docs/intro/installation/wsl-ubuntu-search.png)

If your Ubuntu terminal looks like the image below, you may encounter an issue
where `ctrl + v` (paste keyboard shortcut) doesn't work in the terminal.

![Ubuntu Terminal](/assets/docs/intro/installation/wsl-ubuntu-terminal-1.png)

If you encounter this issue, open Windows Terminal by searching for "Terminal"
in the Search bar.

![Windows Terminal](/assets/docs/intro/installation/wsl-windows-terminal.png)

Next, close the Windows Terminal and reopen a Linux terminal by searching for
Ubuntu again. The terminal should now look like the image below, where
`ctrl + v` (paste keyboard shortcut) works.

![Ubuntu Terminal](/assets/docs/intro/installation/wsl-ubuntu-terminal-2.png)

If you use VS Code, the
[WSL extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial) enables
you to use WSL and VS Code together.

![WSL Setup in VS Code](/assets/docs/intro/installation/wsl-vscode.png)

You should then see the following in the VS Code status bar:

![WSL: Ubuntu](/assets/docs/intro/installation/wsl-vscode-ubuntu.png)

Once you have WSL set up, install all other dependencies through the Ubuntu
(Linux) terminal.

To install the required Solana dependencies, first try running the
[quick installation](#quick-installation) command in the Ubuntu (Linux)
terminal.

<Callout>

If the quick install command doesn't work, install the dependencies specified in
the Linux section below before proceeding to the individual steps for installing
Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor CLI.

If the quick install command runs successfully, skip to the
[Solana CLI Basics](#solana-cli-basics) and
[Anchor CLI Basics](#anchor-cli-basics) sections below.

</Callout>

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Linux">

<Tabs items={[".deb", ".rpm"]}>
  <Tab value=".deb" >
  If on Debian or Debian-dervived alternatives like Ubuntu or Mint, follow the following steps.

  Update the package lists to get the newer versions of packages by running the command.

  ```terminal
  $ sudo apt-get update
  ```

  Next, install the following dependencies:

  ```terminal
  $ sudo apt-get install -y \
      build-essential \
      pkg-config \
      libudev-dev llvm libclang-dev \
      protobuf-compiler libssl-dev
  ```

  If you encounter the following error when installing `protobuf-compiler`, make
  sure you first run _shell`sudo apt-get update`_:

  ```
  Package protobuf-compiler is not available, but is referred to by another package.
  This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
  is only available from another source
  ```
  </Tab>

    <Tab value=".rpm" >
    For RHEL derivatives like Fedora or Red Hat Linux, follow the following steps.

  Update the package lists to get the newer versions of packages by running the command.

  ```terminal
  $ sudo dnf upgrade --refresh

  && sudo dnf install pkg-config openssl-devel
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

<Steps>
<Step>

### Install Rust

Developers build Solana programs using the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Install Rust with [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Run the following command to install Rust:

```terminal
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
```

You should see the following message after the installation completes:

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Successful Rust Install Message">

```
Rust is installed now. Great!

To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

To configure your current shell, you need to source
the corresponding env file under $HOME/.cargo.

This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"            # For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env.fish"  # For fish
```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

Run the following command to reload your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory:

```terminal
$ . "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

To verify the installation succeeded, check the Rust version:

```terminal
$ rustc --version
```

You should see output like the following:

```
rustc 1.86.0 (05f9846f8 2025-03-31)
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Install the Solana CLI

The Solana CLI provides all the tools required to build and deploy Solana
programs.

Install the Solana CLI tool suite using the official install command:

```terminal
$ sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"
```

You can replace `stable` with the release tag matching the software version of
your desired release (i.e. `v2.0.3`), or use one of the three symbolic channel
names: `stable`, `beta`, or `edge`.

For a first-time installation of the Solana CLI, you may see the following
message prompting you to add a `PATH` environment variable:

```
Close and reopen your terminal to apply the PATH changes or run the following in your existing shell:

export PATH="/Users/test/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
```

<Tabs groupId="language" items={["Linux", "Mac"]}>
<Tab value="Linux">

If you are using **Linux** or **WSL**, you need to add the Solana CLI binary to
your `PATH` so that the command is available in your terminal.

First, run the following command to check which shell you are using:

```terminal
$ echo $SHELL
```

- If the output contains `/bash`, use `.bashrc`.
- If the output contains `/zsh`, use `.zshrc`.

Depending on your shell, run the appropriate command.

For Bash (`bashrc`):

```terminal
$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

For Zsh (`zshrc`):

```terminal
$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
$ source ~/.zshrc
```

Then run the following command to refresh the terminal session or restart your
terminal.

```terminal
$ source ~/.bashrc # If using Bash
$ source ~/.zshrc # If using Zsh
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Mac">

If you use a Mac with `zsh`, running the default `export PATH` command logged
from the installation doesn't persist once you close your terminal.

Instead, you can add the PATH to your shell configuration file by running the
following command:

```terminal
$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Then run the following command to refresh the terminal session or restart your
terminal.

```terminal
$ source ~/.zshrc
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

To verify that the installation succeeded, check the Solana CLI version:

```terminal
$ solana --version
```

You should see output like the following:

```
solana-cli 2.2.12 (src:0315eb6a; feat:1522022101, client:Agave)
```

You can view all available versions on the
[Agave Github repo](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/releases).

<Callout>

Agave is the validator client from [Anza](https://www.anza.xyz/), formerly known
as Solana Labs validator client.

</Callout>

To later update the Solana CLI to the latest version, you can use the following
command:

```terminal
$ agave-install update
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Install Anchor CLI

[Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) is a framework for developing Solana
programs. The Anchor framework leverages Rust macros to simplify the process of
writing Solana programs.

You can install the Anchor CLI and tooling in two ways:

1. Anchor Version Manager (AVM) - Recommended installation method
2. Without AVM - Install directly from GitHub

<Tabs groupId="anchor" items={["AVM", "Without AVM"]}>
<Tab value="AVM">

The Anchor version manager (AVM) allows you to install and manage different
Anchor versions on your system and easily update Anchor versions in the future.

Install AVM with the following command:

```terminal
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --force
```

Confirm that AVM installed successfully:

```terminal
$ avm --version
```

Install the latest version of Anchor CLI using AVM:

```terminal
$ avm install latest
$ avm use latest
```

You can install a specific version of Anchor CLI by specifying the version
number:

```terminal
$ avm install 0.30.1
$ avm use 0.30.1
```

<Callout type="info">

Don't forget to run the _shell`avm use`_ command to declare the Anchor CLI
version to run on your system.

- If you installed the `latest` version, run _shell`avm use latest`_.
- If you installed the version `0.30.1`, run _shell`avm use 0.30.1`_.

</Callout>

</Tab>

<Tab value="Without AVM">

Install a specific version of the Anchor CLI with the following command:

```terminal
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor --tag v0.30.1 anchor-cli
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

To verify that the installation succeeded, check the Anchor CLI version:

```terminal
$ anchor --version
```

You should see output like the following:

```
anchor-cli 0.31.1
```

<Callout type="warn">

When installing the Anchor CLI on Linux or WSL, you may encounter this error:

```
error: could not exec the linker cc = note: Permission denied (os error 13)
```

If you see this error message:

1. Install the dependencies listed in the
   [Linux](/docs/intro/installation#install-dependencies) section at the top of
   this page.
2. Retry installing the Anchor CLI.

</Callout>

#### Node.js and Yarn

The default Anchor project test file (TypeScript) created with the
_shell`anchor init`_ command requires Node.js and Yarn. (Rust test template is
available using _shell`anchor init --test-template rust`_)

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Node Installation">

Install node using [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Install nvm using the following command:

```terminal
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
```

Restart your terminal and confirm that the nvm command runs successfully:

```terminal
$ command -v nvm
```

Next, use `nvm` to install node:

```terminal
$ nvm install node
```

To verify that the installation succeeded, check the Node version:

```terminal
$ node --version
```

You should see output like the following:

```
v23.7.0
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Yarn Installation">

Try these solutions:

1. Force install using the following command:

```terminal
$ cargo build-sbf --force-tools-install
```

2. If the preceding solution doesn't work, clear the Solana cache:

```terminal
$ rm -rf ~/.cache/solana/*
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="lock file version 4 requires `-Znext-lockfile-bump">
You can fix this by changing the version field of `Cargo.lock` file from 4 to 3:

```diff title="Cargo.lock"
-version = 4
+version = 3
```

See [this issue](https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/issues/3392) for more
information.

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

After applying the preceding solution, attempt to run _shell`anchor build`_
again.

</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">

When running _shell`anchor test`_ after creating a new Anchor project on Linux
or WSL, you may encounter the following errors if you don't have Node.js or Yarn
installed:

## Solana CLI Basics

This section walks through some common Solana CLI commands to get you started.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Solana Config

To see your current config:

```terminal
$ solana config get
```

You should see output like the following:

```
Config File: /Users/test/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
WebSocket URL: wss://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: /Users/test/.config/solana/id.json
Commitment: confirmed
```

The RPC URL and Websocket URL specify the Solana cluster the CLI makes requests
to.

You can update the Solana CLI cluster using the following commands:

```terminal
$ solana config set --url mainnet-beta
$ solana config set --url devnet
$ solana config set --url localhost
$ solana config set --url testnet
```

You can also use the following short options:

```terminal
$ solana config set -um    # For mainnet-beta
$ solana config set -ud    # For devnet
$ solana config set -ul    # For localhost
$ solana config set -ut    # For testnet
```

The Keypair Path points to the default Solana wallet (keypair) used by the
Solana CLI to pay transaction fees and deploy programs. By default, this file is
stored at `~/.config/solana/id.json`.

</Step>
<Step>

### Create Wallet

To send transactions using the Solana CLI, you need a Solana wallet funded with
SOL.

To generate a keypair at the default Keypair Path, run the following command:

```terminal
$ solana-keygen new
```

You should see output like the following:

```
Generating a new keypair

For added security, enter a BIP39 passphrase

NOTE! This passphrase improves security of the recovery seed phrase NOT the
keypair file itself, which is stored as insecure plain text

BIP39 Passphrase (empty for none):

Wrote new keypair to /Users/test/.config/solana/id.json
===========================================================================
pubkey: 8dBTPrjnkXyuQK3KDt9wrZBfizEZijmmUQXVHpFbVwGT
===========================================================================
Save this seed phrase and your BIP39 passphrase to recover your new keypair:
cream bleak tortoise ocean nasty game gift forget fancy salon mimic amazing
===========================================================================
```

<Callout type="info">

If you already have a file system wallet saved at the default location, this
command doesn't override it unless you explicitly force override using the
`--force` flag.

</Callout>

To view your wallet's address (public key), run:

```terminal
$ solana address
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Airdrop SOL

Request an airdrop of SOL to your wallet to pay for transactions and program
deployments.

Set your cluster to the devnet:

```terminal
$ solana config set -ud
```

Then request an airdrop of devnet SOL:

```terminal
$ solana airdrop 2
```

<Callout>

Devnet airdrops limit requests to 5 SOL per request. If you hit rate limits or
encounter errors, try using the [Web Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com) instead.

</Callout>

To check your wallet's SOL balance, run the following command:

```terminal
$ solana balance
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Run Local Validator

The Solana CLI includes a built-in
[test validator](https://docs.anza.xyz/cli/examples/test-validator) for local
development.

In a separate terminal, run the following command to start a local validator:

```terminal
$ solana-test-validator
```

<Callout>

Remember to also update your CLI to use localhost before running Solana CLI
commands:

```terminal
$ solana config set -ul
```

</Callout>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Anchor CLI Basics

This section walks through some common Anchor CLI commands to get you started.
For more information on the Anchor CLI, see the
[Anchor documentation](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs).

<Steps>
<Step>

### Initialize Project

To create a new Anchor project, run the following command:

```terminal
$ anchor init <project-name>
```

For example, to create a project called `my-project`, run:

```terminal
$ anchor init my-project
```

This command creates a new directory with the project name and initializes a new
Anchor project with a basic Rust program and TypeScript test template.

Navigate to the project directory:

```terminal
$ cd <project-name>
```

See the Anchor project's
[file structure](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/quickstart/local#project-file-structure).

</Step>

<Step>
### Build Program

To build your project, run the following command:

```terminal
$ anchor build
```

You can find the compiled program in the `/target/deploy` directory.

</Step>
<Step>

### Deploy Program

To deploy your project, run the following command:

```terminal
$ anchor deploy
```

This command deploys your program to the `cluster` specified in the
[`Anchor.toml`](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/references/anchor-toml) file.

</Step>
<Step>

### Test Program

To test your project, run the following command:

```terminal
$ anchor test
```

<Callout>

This command builds, deploys, and runs the tests for your project.

When using `localnet` as the `cluster` in `Anchor.toml`, Anchor automatically
starts a local validator, deploys your program, runs tests, and then stops the
validator.

</Callout>

</Step>
