h1: Solana Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Solana Quick Start Guide. This hands-on guide introduces you to
the core concepts for building on Solana, regardless of your prior experience.

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn about:

- **Solana Accounts**: Learn how the Solana network stores data.
- **Sending Transactions**: Learn to interact with the Solana network by sending
  transactions.
- **Building and Deploying Programs**: Create your first Solana program and
  deploy it to the network.
- **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**: Learn how to use PDAs to create
  deterministic addresses for accounts.
- **Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs)**: Learn how to call other programs from
  within your program, enabling complex interactions and composability between
  different programs on Solana.

The best part? You don't need to install anything. This guide uses Solana
Playground, a browser-based development environment. Follow along, copy, and
paste code, and see results immediately, all from your web browser. Basic
programming knowledge helps but isn't required.

Time to dive in and start building on Solana.

## Solana Playground

Solana Playground (Solpg) provides a browser-based development environment that
allows you to quickly develop, deploy, and test Solana programs.

Open a new tab in your web browser and navigate to https://beta.solpg.io/.

### Create Playground Wallet

New Solana Playground users should first create a Playground Wallet. This wallet
enables you to interact with the Solana network right from your browser.

#### Step 1. Connect to Playground

Click the "Not connected" button at the bottom left of the screen.

#### Step 2. Create Your Wallet

The system prompts you to save your wallet's keypair. Once ready, click
"Continue" to proceed.

You should now see your wallet's address, SOL balance, and connected cluster
(devnet by default) at the bottom of the window.

<Callout>
  Your browser's local storage saves your Playground Wallet. Clearing your
  browser cache removes your saved wallet. Use your Playground Wallet only for
  testing and development. Don't send real assets (from mainnet) to this
  address.
</Callout>

Some definitions you may find helpful:

- _wallet address_: a 32-byte public key from a Ed25519 keypair, generally
  displayed as a base-58 encoded string (e.g.,
  `7MNj7pL1y7XpPnN7ZeuaE4ctwg3WeufbX5o85sA91J1`). The corresponding private key
  signs transactions from this address. On Solana, an address serves as the
  unique identifier for a user's wallet, a program (smart contract), or any
  other account on the network.
- _connected cluster_: the Solana network for your current interactions. Common
  clusters include:
  - `devnet`: A development network for developer experimentation
  - `testnet`: A network reserved for validator testing (don't use as app
    developer)
  - `mainnet-beta`: The main Solana network for live transactions

</Step>

### Get Devnet SOL

Before starting development, you need to get some devnet SOL.

As a developer, you need SOL for two main use cases:

- Creating new accounts to store data or deploy programs on the network
- Paying transaction fees when interacting with the Solana network

Two methods to fund your wallet with devnet SOL:

#### Option 1: Using the Playground Terminal

To fund your Playground wallet with devnet SOL. In the Playground terminal, run:

```terminal
$ solana airdrop 5
```

#### Option 2: Using the Devnet Faucet

If the airdrop command doesn't work (due to rate limits or errors), you can use
the [Web Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/).

- Enter your wallet address (found at the bottom of the Playground screen) and
  select an amount
- Click "Confirm Airdrop" to receive your devnet SOL
