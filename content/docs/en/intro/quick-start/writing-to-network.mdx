title: Writing to Network
description:
  Learn how to interact with the Solana network by sending transactions and
  instructions. Follow step-by-step examples to transfer SOL tokens and create
  new tokens using the System Program and Token Extensions Program.
---

In the previous section, you learned how to read data from the Solana network.
Now explore how to write data to it. Writing to the Solana network involves
sending transactions that contain one or more instructions.

Programs (smart contracts) process these instructions according to their
business logic for each respective instruction. When you submit a transaction,
the Solana runtime executes each instruction in sequence and atomically (meaning
either all instructions succeed or the entire transaction fails).

In this section, you'll see two basic examples:

1. Transferring SOL between accounts
2. Creating a new token

These examples show how to build and send transactions to invoke Solana
programs. For more details, refer to the
[Transactions and Instructions](/docs/core/transactions) and
[Fees on Solana](/docs/core/fees) pages.

## Transfer SOL

Start with a simple example of transferring SOL between accounts. To transfer
SOL from the Playground wallet, you need to invoke the System Program's
[transfer](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/v2.1.11/programs/system/src/system_processor.rs#L183-L213)
instruction.

A key concept of Solana's account model requires that only the program that owns
an account can deduct an account's lamport (SOL) balance. This means if you want
to transfer SOL from a wallet account, you must invoke the System Program since
it appears as the program owner in the
[owner](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/v2.1.11/sdk/account/src/lib.rs#L55)
field of the account.

### Open Example

Click this [link](https://beta.solpg.io/6671d85ecffcf4b13384d19e) to open the
example in Solana Playground. You'll see the following code:

<WithNotes>

```ts title="client.ts"
import {
  LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
  SystemProgram,
  Transaction,
  sendAndConfirmTransaction,
  Keypair,
} from "@solana/web3.js";

// !tooltip[/sender/] sender
const sender = pg.wallet.keypair;

// !tooltip[/receiver/] receiver
const receiver = new Keypair();

// !tooltip[/transferInstruction/] instruction
const transferInstruction = SystemProgram.transfer({
  fromPubkey: sender.publicKey,
  toPubkey: receiver.publicKey,
  lamports: 0.01 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
});

// !tooltip[/transaction/] transaction
const transaction = new Transaction().add(transferInstruction);

// !tooltip[/sendAndConfirmTransaction/] sendAndConfirmTransaction
const transactionSignature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  pg.connection,
  transaction,
  [sender],
);

console.log(
  "Transaction Signature:",
  `https://solana.fm/tx/${transactionSignature}?cluster=devnet-solana`,
);
```

### !sender

Define `sender` as the Playground wallet's keypair.

### !receiver

Define `receiver` as a new keypair.

### !instruction

Build instruction to invoke the System Program's transfer instruction.

### !transaction

Create new transaction and add the transfer instruction.

### !sendAndConfirmTransaction

Send the transaction.

</WithNotes>

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Explanation">

This example does the following:

- Set your Playground wallet as the `sender`

  ```ts
  const sender = pg.wallet.keypair;
  ```

- Creates a new keypair as the `receiver`

  ```ts
  const receiver = new Keypair();
  ```

<WithMentions>

- Constructs a transfer instruction to [transfer 0.01 SOL](mention:one)

  ```ts
  const transferInstruction = SystemProgram.transfer({
    fromPubkey: sender.publicKey,
    toPubkey: receiver.publicKey,
    // !mention one
    lamports: 0.01 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
  });
  ```

</WithMentions>

- Builds a transaction including the transfer instruction

  ```ts
  const transaction = new Transaction().add(transferInstruction);
  ```

- Sends and confirms the transaction

  ```ts
  const transactionSignature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
    pg.connection,
    transaction,
    [sender],
  );
  ```

- Prints out a link to the SolanaFM explorer in the Playground terminal to view
  the transaction details

  ```ts
  console.log(
    "Transaction Signature:",
    `https://solana.fm/tx/${transactionSignature}?cluster=devnet-solana`,

Congratulations. You've just sent your first transaction on Solana.

- First, you created an instruction specifying what to do
- Then, you added that instruction to a transaction
- Finally, you sent the transaction for the Solana network to process

This represents the basic pattern for building transactions to interact with the
programs on the Solana.

## Create a Token

Next, create a new token using the Token Extensions Program. This requires
invoking two instructions:

1. Create a new account using the System Program
2. Initialize the account's data as a Mint using the Token Extensions Program

```

### !wallet

Define `wallet` as the Playground wallet.

### !mint

Generate a new keypair to use as the address of the Mint account to create.

### !rentLamports

Calculate the lamports needed for a Mint account.

### !createAccountInstruction

Build instruction to create a new account with space for the Mint account type
and owned by the Token Extensions Program.

### !initializeMintInstruction

Build instruction to initialize the data of the new account as a Mint account
type.

### !transaction

Create new transaction and add both instructions.

The order of instructions matters here. The `createAccountInstruction` must come
before the `initializeMintInstruction`.

### !sendAndConfirmTransaction

Send the transaction.

<Accordion title="Explanation">

This example does the following:

- Gets your Playground wallet and creates a connection to the Solana devnet

  ```ts
  const wallet = pg.wallet;
  const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl("devnet"), "confirmed");
  ```

- Generates a new keypair to use as the address of the Mint account

  ```ts
  const mint = new Keypair();
  ```

- Calculates the lamports needed for a Mint account

  ```ts
  const rentLamports = await getMinimumBalanceForRentExemptMint(connection);
  ```

<WithMentions>

- Construct a System Program instruction to create a new account. The
  instruction:

  1. [Allocates the required space](mention:one) for storing mint data
  2. [Transfers lamports](mention:two) from the wallet to fund the new account
  3. [Assigns ownership](mention:three) of the account to the Token Extensions
     program (`TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID`)

  ```ts
  const createAccountInstruction = SystemProgram.createAccount({
    fromPubkey: wallet.publicKey,
    newAccountPubkey: mint.publicKey,
    // !mention one
    space: MINT_SIZE,
    // !mention two
    lamports: rentLamports,
    // !mention three
    programId: TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
  });
  ```

</WithMentions>

- Construct a Token Extensions Program instruction to initialize the Mint
  account data

  ```ts
  const initializeMintInstruction = createInitializeMint2Instruction(
    mint.publicKey,
    2,
    wallet.publicKey,
    wallet.publicKey,
    TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
  );
  ```

<WithMentions>

- Adds [both instructions](mention:one) to a single transaction

  ```ts
  const transaction = new Transaction().add(
    // !mention one
    createAccountInstruction,
    // !mention one
    initializeMintInstruction,
  );
  ```

</WithMentions>

<WithMentions>

- Sends and confirms the transaction with [two required signers](mention:one):

  1. The wallet keypair to pay for account creation and transaction fee
  2. The mint keypair to create a new account using its public key as the
     address of the account

  ```ts
  const transactionSignature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
    connection,
    transaction,
    // !mention one
    [wallet.keypair, mint],

- Prints out links to view the transaction and mint account details on SolanaFM

You'll see two links printed to the Playground terminal:

- One for the transaction details
- One for the newly created mint account

Click the links to inspect the transaction details and the newly created mint
account on SolanaFM.

![Mint Account](/assets/docs/intro/quickstart/mint-account.png)

In this example, you saw how to combine instructions into a single transaction.
The transaction contains two key instructions:

1. Creating a new account using the System Program
2. Initializing that account as a token mint using the Token Extensions Program

This pattern of combining instructions from different programs into one
transaction occurs frequently when building complex Solana transactions. It
allows sequential and atomic execution of instructions, ensuring they either all
succeed or all fail together.
