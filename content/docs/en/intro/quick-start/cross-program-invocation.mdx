title: Composing Multiple Programs
description:
  Learn how to implement Cross Program Invocations (CPIs) in Solana programs
  using the Anchor framework. This tutorial demonstrates how to transfer SOL
  between accounts, interact with the System Program, and handle Program Derived
  Addresses (PDAs) in CPIs. Perfect for developers looking to build composable
  Solana programs.
h1: Cross Program Invocation
---

In this section, the CRUD program from the previous PDA section gets updated by
adding Cross Program Invocations (CPIs), a feature that enables Solana programs
to invoke each other.

This tutorial also shows how programs can "sign" for Program Derived Addresses
(PDAs) when making Cross Program Invocations.

The `update` and `delete` instructions need modification to handle SOL transfers
between accounts by invoking the System Program.

The purpose of this section includes walking through the process of implementing
CPIs in a Solana program using the Anchor framework, building upon the PDA
concepts explored in the previous section. For more details, refer to the
[Cross Program Invocation](/docs/core/cpi) page.

For reference, this link includes the
[final code](https://beta.solpg.io/668304cfcffcf4b13384d20a) after completing
both the PDA and CPI sections.

The [starter code](https://beta.solpg.io/679d75eecffcf4b13384d604) for this
section includes just the PDA section completed.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Update the Update Instruction

First, the program needs a simple "pay-to-update" mechanism by changing the
_rs`Update`_ struct and `update` function.

Begin by updating the `lib.rs` file to bring into scope items from the
`system_program` module.

```rs title="lib.rs"
use anchor_lang::system_program::{transfer, Transfer};
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Diff">

```diff
  use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
+ use anchor_lang::system_program::{transfer, Transfer};
```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

Next, update the _rs`Update`_ struct to include a new account called
`vault_account`. This account, controlled by the program, receives SOL from a
user when they update their message account.

```rs title="lib.rs"
#[account(
    mut,
    seeds = [b"vault", user.key().as_ref()],
    bump,
)]
pub vault_account: SystemAccount<'info>,
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Diff">

```diff
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(message: String)]
pub struct Update<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,

+   #[account(
+       mut,
+       seeds = [b"vault", user.key().as_ref()],
+       bump,
+   )]
+   pub vault_account: SystemAccount<'info>,
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [b"message", user.key().as_ref()],
        bump = message_account.bump,
        realloc = 8 + 32 + 4 + message.len() + 1,
        realloc::payer = user,
        realloc::zero = true,
    )]
    pub message_account: Account<'info, MessageAccount>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Explanation">

This section adds a new account called `vault_account` to the _rs`Update`_
struct. This account serves as a program-controlled "vault" that receives SOL
from users when they update their messages.

By using a PDA for the vault, the program creates a program-controlled account
unique to each user, enabling fund management within the program's logic.

---

Key aspects of the `vault_account`:

- The address of the account comes from a PDA derived using seeds
  _rs`[b"vault", user.key().as_ref()]`_
- As a PDA, it has no private key, so only the program can "sign" for the
  address when performing CPIs
- As a _rs`SystemAccount`_ type, the System Program owns it like regular wallet
  accounts

This setup allows the program to:

- Generate unique, deterministic addresses for each user's "vault"
- Control funds without needing a private key to sign for transactions.

In the `delete` instruction, you'll see how the program can "sign" for this PDA
in a CPI.

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

Next, add the CPI logic in the `update` instruction to transfer 0.001 SOL from
the user's account to the vault account.

<WithNotes>

```rs title="lib.rs"
// !tooltip[/transfer_accounts/] transfer_accounts
let transfer_accounts = Transfer {
    from: ctx.accounts.user.to_account_info(),
    to: ctx.accounts.vault_account.to_account_info(),
};

// !tooltip[/cpi_context/] cpi_context
let cpi_context = CpiContext::new(
    ctx.accounts.system_program.to_account_info(),
    transfer_accounts,
);

// !tooltip[/transfer/] transfer
transfer(cpi_context, 1_000_000)?;
```

### !transfer_accounts

The _rs`Transfer`_ struct specifies the required accounts for the System
Program's transfer instruction.

### !cpi_context

The _rs`CpiContext`_ struct specifies the program and accounts for a Cross
Program Invocation (CPI).

### !transfer

The _rs`transfer()`_ function invokes the System Program's transfer instruction.

<Accordion title="Diff">

```diff
    pub fn update(ctx: Context<Update>, message: String) -> Result<()> {
        msg!("Update Message: {}", message);

        account_data.message = message;

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Explanation">

In the `update` instruction, the implementation includes a Cross Program
Invocation (CPI) to invoke the System Program's `transfer` instruction. This
demonstrates how to perform a CPI from within the program, enabling the
composability of Solana programs.

The _rs`Transfer`_ struct specifies the required accounts for the System
Program's transfer instruction:

- `from` - The user's account (source of funds)
- `to` - The vault account (destination of funds)

  ```rs title="lib.rs"
  let transfer_accounts = Transfer {
      from: ctx.accounts.user.to_account_info(),
      to: ctx.accounts.vault_account.to_account_info(),
  };
  ```

The _rs`CpiContext`_ specifies:

- The program to invoke (System Program)
- The accounts required in the CPI (defined in the _rs`Transfer`_ struct)

  ```rs title="lib.rs"
  let cpi_context = CpiContext::new(
      ctx.accounts.system_program.to_account_info(),
      transfer_accounts,
  );
  ```

The `transfer` function then invokes the transfer instruction on the System
Program, passing in the:

- The `cpi_context` (program and accounts)
- The `amount` to transfer (1,000,000 lamports, or 0.001 SOL)

  ```rs title="lib.rs"
  transfer(cpi_context, 1_000_000)?;
  ```

<Callout>

The setup for a CPI matches how client-side instructions get built, where you
specify the program, accounts, and instruction data for a particular instruction
to invoke. When the program's `update` instruction receives an invocation, it
internally invokes the System Program's transfer instruction.

</Callout>

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

Rebuild the program.

```terminal
$ build
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Update the Delete Instruction

Now add a "refund on delete" mechanism by changing the _rs`Delete`_ struct and
`delete` function.

First, update the _rs`Delete`_ struct to include the `vault_account`. This
allows the transfer of any SOL in the vault back to the user when they close
their message account.

```rs title="lib.rs"
#[account(
    mut,
    seeds = [b"vault", user.key().as_ref()],
    bump,
)]
pub vault_account: SystemAccount<'info>,
```

Also add the `system_program` as the CPI for the transfer requires invoking the
System Program.

```rs title="lib.rs"
pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Diff">

```diff
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Delete<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,

+   #[account(
+       mut,
+       seeds = [b"vault", user.key().as_ref()],
+       bump,
+   )]
+   pub vault_account: SystemAccount<'info>,
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [b"message", user.key().as_ref()],
        bump = message_account.bump,
        close= user,
    )]
    pub message_account: Account<'info, MessageAccount>,
+   pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Explanation">

The `vault_account` uses the same PDA derivation as in the Update struct.

Adding the `vault_account` to the Delete struct enables the program to access
the user's vault account during the delete instruction to transfer any
accumulated SOL back to the user.

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

<WithNotes>

Next, add the CPI logic in the `delete` instruction to transfer SOL from the
vault account back to the user's account.

```rs title="lib.rs"
let user_key = ctx.accounts.user.key();
// !tooltip[/signer_seeds/] signer_seeds
let signer_seeds: &[&[&[u8]]] =
    &[&[b"vault", user_key.as_ref(), &[ctx.bumps.vault_account]]];

let transfer_accounts = Transfer {
    from: ctx.accounts.vault_account.to_account_info(),
    to: ctx.accounts.user.to_account_info(),
};
let cpi_context = CpiContext::new(
    ctx.accounts.system_program.to_account_info(),
    transfer_accounts,
// !tooltip[/with_signer/] with_signer
).with_signer(signer_seeds);
transfer(cpi_context, ctx.accounts.vault_account.lamports())?;
```

### !signer_seeds

The _rs`signer_seeds`_ specify the optional seeds and bump seeds used to derive
the PDA.

### !with_signer

The _rs`with_signer()`_ method passes the signer seeds with the CPI.

This allows a program to "sign" for a PDA that derived from its program ID.

During instruction processing, the runtime verifies that the provided signer
seeds correctly derive to the PDA's address. If verified, the runtime treats
that PDA account as a signer for the duration of the CPI.

</WithNotes>

Note that _rs`_ctx: Context<Delete>`_ changes to _rs`ctx: Context<Delete>`_ to
use the context in the body of the function.

<Accordion title="Diff">

```diff
-    pub fn delete(_ctx: Context<Delete>) -> Result<()> {

+        };
+        let cpi_context = CpiContext::new(

+            transfer_accounts,
+        ).with_signer(signer_seeds);

         Ok(())
     }

```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Explanation">

In the delete instruction, another Cross Program Invocation (CPI) implements the
System Program's transfer instruction. This CPI demonstrates how to make a
transfer that requires a Program Derived Address (PDA) signer.

First, define the signer seeds for the vault PDA:

```rs title="lib.rs"
let user_key = ctx.accounts.user.key();
let signer_seeds: &[&[&[u8]]] =
    &[&[b"vault", user_key.as_ref(), &[ctx.bumps.vault_account]]];
```

The _rs`Transfer`_ struct specifies the required accounts for the System
Program's transfer instruction:

- from: The vault account (source of funds)
- to: The user's account (destination of funds)

  ```rs title="lib.rs"
  let transfer_accounts = Transfer {
      from: ctx.accounts.vault_account.to_account_info(),
      to: ctx.accounts.user.to_account_info(),
  };
  ```

The _rs`CpiContext`_ specifies:

- The program to invoke (System Program)
- The accounts involved in the transfer (defined in the Transfer struct)
- The signer seeds for the PDA

  ```rs title="lib.rs"
  let cpi_context = CpiContext::new(
      ctx.accounts.system_program.to_account_info(),
      transfer_accounts,
  ).with_signer(signer_seeds);
  ```

The _rs`transfer()`_ function then invokes the transfer instruction on the
System Program, passing:

- The `cpi_context` (program, accounts, and PDA signer)
- The amount to transfer (the entire balance of the vault account)

  ```rs title="lib.rs"
  transfer(cpi_context, ctx.accounts.vault_account.lamports())?;
  ```

This CPI implementation shows how programs can use PDAs to manage funds. When
the program's delete instruction receives an invocation, it internally calls the
System Program's transfer instruction, signing for the PDA to allow the transfer
of all funds from the vault back to the user.

</Accordions>

Rebuild the program.

```terminal
$ build
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Redeploy Program

After making these changes, redeploy the updated program. This ensures the
modified program becomes available for testing. On Solana, updating a program
simply requires deploying the program at the same program ID.

<Callout>

Ensure your Playground wallet has devnet SOL. Get devnet SOL from the
[Solana Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/).

</Callout>

```terminal
$ deploy
Deploying... This could take a while depending on the program size and network conditions.
Deployment successful. Completed in 17s.
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Explanation">

Only the upgrade authority of the program can update it. The developer sets the
upgrade authority during program deployment, and it remains the only account
with permission to change or close the program. If someone revokes the upgrade
authority, then the program becomes immutable.

When deploying programs on Solana Playground, your Playground wallet acts as the
upgrade authority for all your programs.

<Step>

### Update Test File

Next, update the `anchor.test.ts` file to include the new vault account in the
instructions. This requires deriving the vault PDA and including it in the
update and delete instruction calls.

#### Derive Vault PDA

First, add the vault PDA derivation:

```ts title="anchor.test.ts"
const [vaultPda, vaultBump] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [Buffer.from("vault"), wallet.publicKey.toBuffer()],
  program.programId,
);
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Diff">

```diff
describe("pda", () => {
  const program = pg.program;
  const wallet = pg.wallet;

  const [messagePda, messageBump] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
    [Buffer.from("message"), wallet.publicKey.toBuffer()],
    program.programId
  );

+  const [vaultPda, vaultBump] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
+    [Buffer.from("vault"), wallet.publicKey.toBuffer()],
+    program.programId
+  );

  // ...tests
  });
```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

#### Change Update Test

<WithMentions>

Then, update the update instruction to include the [`vaultAccount`](mention:one)

```ts title="anchor.test.ts"  {5}
const transactionSignature = await program.methods
  .update(message)
  .accounts({
    messageAccount: messagePda,
    // !mention one
    vaultAccount: vaultPda,
  })
  .rpc({ commitment: "confirmed" });
```

</WithMentions>

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Diff">

```diff
    const transactionSignature = await program.methods
      .update(message)
      .accounts({

      })
      .rpc({ commitment: "confirmed" });
```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

#### Change Delete Test

<WithMentions>

Then, update the delete instruction to include the [`vaultAccount`](mention:one)

```ts title="anchor.test.ts"  {5}
const transactionSignature = await program.methods
  .delete()
  .accounts({
    messageAccount: messagePda,
    // !mention one
    vaultAccount: vaultPda,
  })
  .rpc({ commitment: "confirmed" });
```

</WithMentions>

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Diff">

```diff
    const transactionSignature = await program.methods

      })
      .rpc({ commitment: "confirmed" });
```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

</Step>
<Step>

### Rerun Test

After making these changes, run the tests to ensure everything works as
expected:

```terminal
$ test

You can then inspect the SolanaFM links to view the transaction details, where
you'll find the CPIs for the transfer instructions within the update and delete
instructions.
