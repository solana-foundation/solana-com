h1: sendTransaction RPC Method
---

Submits a signed transaction to the cluster for processing.

This method does not alter the transaction in any way; it relays the transaction
created by clients to the node as-is.

If the node's rpc service receives the transaction, this method immediately
succeeds, without waiting for any confirmations. A successful response from this
method does not guarantee the transaction is processed or confirmed by the
cluster.

While the rpc service will reasonably retry to submit it, the transaction could
be rejected if transaction's `recent_blockhash` expires before it lands.

Use [`getSignatureStatuses`](/docs/rpc/http/getsignaturestatuses) to ensure a
transaction is processed and confirmed.

Before submitting, the following preflight checks are performed:

1. The transaction signatures are verified
2. The transaction is simulated against the bank slot specified by the preflight
   commitment. On failure an error will be returned. Preflight checks may be
   disabled if desired. It is recommended to specify the same commitment and
   preflight commitment to avoid confusing behavior.

The returned signature is the first signature in the transaction, which is used
to identify the transaction
([transaction id](/docs/references/terminology#transaction-id)). This identifier
can be easily extracted from the transaction data before submission.

### !params

#### !! transaction

!type string  
!required

Fully-signed Transaction, as encoded string.

#### !! config

!type object

Configuration object containing the following fields:

##### !! encoding

!type string  
!values base58 base64  
!default base58

Encoding used for the transaction data. Values: `base58` (_slow_,
**DEPRECATED**), or `base64`.

##### !! skipPreflight

!type bool

When `true`, skip the preflight transaction checks. Default: `false`.

##### !! preflightCommitment

!type string

Commitment level to use for preflight. See
[Configuring State Commitment](/docs/rpc/index.mdx#configuring-state-commitment).
Default `finalized`.

##### !! maxRetries

!type usize

Maximum number of times for the RPC node to retry sending the transaction to the
leader. If this parameter not provided, the RPC node will retry the transaction
until it is finalized or until the blockhash expires.

##### !! minContextSlot

!type number  
!optional

Set the minimum slot at which to perform preflight transaction checks

### !!result

```jsonc !response
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  // !hover result
  "result": "2id3YC2jK9G5Wo2phDx4gJVAew8DcY5NAojnVuao8rkxwPYPe8cSwE5GzhEgJA2y8fVjDEo6iR6ykBvDxrTQrtpb",
  "id": 1
}
```

!type string

First Transaction Signature embedded in the transaction, as base-58 encoded
string ([transaction id](/docs/references/terminology#transaction-id))
