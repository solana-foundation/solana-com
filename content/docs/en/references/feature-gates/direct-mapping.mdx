This feature gate enables direct mapping of accounts in the virtual machine,
improving performance of the virtual machine.

## Impact

This is one of a series of changes to improve performance of the virtual
machine. **Developers** should avoid writing to read-only accounts in sBPF
programs because this will result in transaction failure once this feature gate
is enabled.

## Activation

This feature is not yet activated on mainnet.
