**Feature Key**:
[`tSynMCspg4xFiCj1v3TDb4c7crMR5tSBhLz4sF7rrNA`](https://explorer.solana.com/address/tSynMCspg4xFiCj1v3TDb4c7crMR5tSBhLz4sF7rrNA)

This feature gate adds a new vote instruction as the default. Existing vote
instructions will continue to work, but new votes will use the new instruction
format going forward.

## Impact

**Data providers** will need to be updated to track the new vote instruction, as
the new instruction format may not be captured in existing vote pipelines.

## Activation

This feature is live on mainnet beta as of
[epoch 749](https://explorer.solana.com/epoch/748) (around 10pm ET on
2025-02-27)
