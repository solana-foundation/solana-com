On Solana, "smart contracts" are called programs.
[Programs](/docs/core/accounts#program-account) are deployed on-chain to
accounts that contain the program's compiled executable binary. Users interact
with programs by sending transactions containing
[instructions](/docs/core/transactions#instruction) that tell the program what
to do.

## Key Points

- Programs are accounts containing **executable code**, organized into functions
  called **instructions**.
- While programs are **stateless**, they can include instructions that create
  and update other accounts to store data.
- An **upgrade authority** can update programs. Once this authority is removed,
  the program becomes immutable.
- Users can verify an on-chain program account's data matches its public source
  code through verifiable builds.

## Writing Solana Programs

Solana programs are predominantly written in the
[Rust](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/title-page.html) programming language,
with two common approaches for development:

- [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs): A framework designed for Solana
  program development. It provides a faster and simpler way to write programs,
  using Rust macros to significantly reduce boilerplate code. For beginners, it
  is recommended to start with the Anchor framework.

- [Native Rust](/docs/programs/rust): This approach involves writing Solana
  programs in Rust without leveraging any frameworks. It offers more flexibility
  but comes with increased complexity.

## Updating Solana Programs

To learn more about deploying and upgrading programs, see the
[deploying programs](/docs/programs/deploying) page.

On-chain programs can be
[directly modified](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/v2.1.13/programs/bpf_loader/src/lib.rs#L704)
by an account designated as the "upgrade authority", which is typically the
account that originally deployed the program. If the
[upgrade authority](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/v2.1.13/programs/bpf_loader/src/lib.rs#L894)
is revoked and set to `None`, the program becomes immutable and can no longer be
updated.

## Verifiable Programs

Verifiable builds allow anyone to check if a program's on-chain code matches its
public source code, making it possible to detect discrepancies between source
and deployed versions.

The Solana developer community has introduced tools to support verifiable
builds, enabling both developers and users to verify that onchain programs
accurately reflect their publicly shared source code.

- **Searching for Verified Programs**: To quickly check for verified programs,
  users can search for a program address on the [SolanaFM](https://solana.fm/)
  Explorer and navigate to the "Verification" tab. View an example of a verified
  program
  [here](https://solana.fm/address/PhoeNiXZ8ByJGLkxNfZRnkUfjvmuYqLR89jjFHGqdXY).

- **Verification Tools**: The
  [Solana Verifiable Build CLI](https://github.com/Ellipsis-Labs/solana-verifiable-build)
  by Ellipsis Labs enables users to independently verify onchain programs
  against published source code.

- **Support for Verifiable Builds in Anchor**: Anchor provides built-in support
  for verifiable builds. Details can be found in the
  [Anchor documentation](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/verifiable-builds).

## Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF)

Solana uses [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) to compile programs into
[ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) files. These
files contain Solana's custom version of
[eBPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBPF) bytecode, called "Solana Bytecode
Format" (sBPF). The ELF file contains the program's binary and is stored
on-chain in an executable account when the program is deployed.

## Built-in Programs

### Loader Programs

Every program itself is owned by another program, which is its loader. There
are currently five loaders:

1. native loader:

  - Program id: `NativeLoader1111111111111111111111111111111`
  - Owns the other four loaders

2. loader-v1:

  - Program id: `BPFLoader1111111111111111111111111111111111`
  - Management instructions are disabled, but programs still execute

3. loader-v2:

  - Program id: `BPFLoader2111111111111111111111111111111111`
  - [Instructions](https://docs.rs/solana-loader-v2-interface/latest/solana_loader_v2_interface/enum.LoaderInstruction.html)
  - Management instructions are disabled, but programs still execute

4. loader-v3:

  - Program id: `BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e11111111111111111111111`
  - [Instructions](https://docs.rs/solana-loader-v3-interface/latest/solana_loader_v3_interface/instruction/enum.UpgradeableLoaderInstruction.html)
  - Is being phased out

5. loader-v4:

  - Program id: `LoaderV411111111111111111111111111111111111`
  - [Instructions](https://docs.rs/solana-loader-v4-interface/latest/solana_loader_v4_interface/instruction/enum.LoaderV4Instruction.html)
  - Will become the standard loader

These loaders are necessary to create and manage custom programs:

- Deploy a new program or buffer
- Close a program or buffer
- Redeploy / upgrade an existing program
- Transfer the authority over a program
- Finalize a program

Loader-v3 and loader-v4 support modifications to programs after their initial
deployment. Permission to do so is regulated by the authority of a program
because the account ownership of each program resides with the loader.

### Precompile Programs

#### Ed25519 Program

The program for verifying ed25519 signatures. It takes an ed25519 signature, a public key, and a message.
Multiple signatures can be verified. If any of the signatures fail to verify, an error is returned.

- Program id: `Ed25519SigVerify111111111111111111111111111`
- [Instructions](https://docs.rs/solana-ed25519-program/latest/solana_ed25519_program/index.html)

The ed25519 program processes an instruction. The first `u8` is a count of the number of
signatures to check, which is followed by a single byte padding. After that, the
following struct is serialized, one for each signature to check.

```
struct Ed25519SignatureOffsets {
    signature_offset: u16,             // offset to ed25519 signature of 64 bytes
    signature_instruction_index: u16,  // instruction index to find signature
    public_key_offset: u16,            // offset to public key of 32 bytes
    public_key_instruction_index: u16, // instruction index to find public key
    message_data_offset: u16,          // offset to start of message data
    message_data_size: u16,            // size of message data
    message_instruction_index: u16,    // index of instruction data to get message data
}
```

The pseudo code of the signature verification:

```
process_instruction() {
    for i in 0..count {
        // i'th index values referenced:
        instructions = &transaction.message().instructions
        instruction_index = ed25519_signature_instruction_index != u16::MAX ? ed25519_signature_instruction_index : current_instruction;
        signature = instructions[instruction_index].data[ed25519_signature_offset..ed25519_signature_offset + 64]
        instruction_index = ed25519_pubkey_instruction_index != u16::MAX ? ed25519_pubkey_instruction_index : current_instruction;
        pubkey = instructions[instruction_index].data[ed25519_pubkey_offset..ed25519_pubkey_offset + 32]
        instruction_index = ed25519_message_instruction_index != u16::MAX ? ed25519_message_instruction_index : current_instruction;
        message = instructions[instruction_index].data[ed25519_message_data_offset..ed25519_message_data_offset + ed25519_message_data_size]
        if pubkey.verify(signature, message) != Success {
            return Error
        }
    }
    return Success
}
```

#### Secp256k1 Program

Verify secp256k1 public key recovery operations (ecrecover).

- Program id: `KeccakSecp256k11111111111111111111111111111`
- [Instructions](https://docs.rs/solana-secp256k1-program/latest/solana_secp256k1_program/index.html)

The secp256k1 program processes an instruction which takes in as the first byte
a count of the following struct serialized in the instruction data:

```
struct Secp256k1SignatureOffsets {
    secp_signature_offset: u16,            // offset to [signature,recovery_id] of 64+1 bytes
    secp_signature_instruction_index: u8,  // instruction index to find signature
    secp_pubkey_offset: u16,               // offset to ethereum_address pubkey of 20 bytes
    secp_pubkey_instruction_index: u8,     // instruction index to find pubkey
    secp_message_data_offset: u16,         // offset to start of message data
    secp_message_data_size: u16,           // size of message data
    secp_message_instruction_index: u8,    // instruction index to find message data
}
```

The pseudo code of the recovery verification:

```
process_instruction() {
  for i in 0..count {
      // i'th index values referenced:
      instructions = &transaction.message().instructions
      signature = instructions[secp_signature_instruction_index].data[secp_signature_offset..secp_signature_offset + 64]
      recovery_id = instructions[secp_signature_instruction_index].data[secp_signature_offset + 64]
      ref_eth_pubkey = instructions[secp_pubkey_instruction_index].data[secp_pubkey_offset..secp_pubkey_offset + 20]
      message_hash = keccak256(instructions[secp_message_instruction_index].data[secp_message_data_offset..secp_message_data_offset + secp_message_data_size])
      pubkey = ecrecover(signature, recovery_id, message_hash)
      eth_pubkey = keccak256(pubkey[1..])[12..]
      if eth_pubkey != ref_eth_pubkey {
          return Error
      }
  }
  return Success
}
```

This allows the user to specify any instruction data in the transaction for
signature and message data. By specifying a special instructions sysvar, one can
also receive data from the transaction itself.

Cost of the transaction will count the number of signatures to verify multiplied
by the signature cost verify multiplier.

#### Secp256r1 Program

The program for verifying secp256r1 signatures. It takes a secp256r1 signature,
a public key, and a message. Up to 8 signatures can be verified. If any of the
signatures fail to verify, an error is returned.

- Program id: `Secp256r1SigVerify1111111111111111111111111`
- [Instructions](https://docs.rs/solana-secp256k1-recover/latest/solana_secp256k1_recover/index.html)

The secp256r1 program processes an instruction. The first `u8` is a count of the number of signatures to check, followed by a single byte padding. After that, the following struct is serialized, one for each signature to check:

```rust
struct Secp256r1SignatureOffsets {
    signature_offset: u16,             // offset to compact secp256r1 signature of 64 bytes
    signature_instruction_index: u16,  // instruction index to find signature
    public_key_offset: u16,            // offset to compressed public key of 33 bytes
    public_key_instruction_index: u16, // instruction index to find public key
    message_data_offset: u16,          // offset to start of message data
    message_data_size: u16,            // size of message data
    message_instruction_index: u16,    // index of instruction data to get message data
}

```

The pseudo code of the signature verification:
```
process_instruction() {
    if data.len() < SIGNATURE_OFFSETS_START {
        return Error
    }

    num_signatures = data[0] as usize
    if num_signatures == 0 || num_signatures > 8 {
        return Error
    }

    expected_data_size = num_signatures * SIGNATURE_OFFSETS_SERIALIZED_SIZE + SIGNATURE_OFFSETS_START
    if data.len() < expected_data_size {
        return Error
    }

    for i in 0..num_signatures {
        offsets = parse_signature_offsets(data, i)

        signature = get_data_slice(data, instruction_datas, offsets.signature_instruction_index, offsets.signature_offset, SIGNATURE_SERIALIZED_SIZE)

        if s > half_curve_order {
            return Error
        }

        pubkey = get_data_slice(data, instruction_datas, offsets.public_key_instruction_index, offsets.public_key_offset, COMPRESSED_PUBKEY_SERIALIZED_SIZE)

        message = get_data_slice(data, instruction_datas, offsets.message_instruction_index, offsets.message_data_offset, offsets.message_data_size)

        if !verify_signature(signature, pubkey, message) {
            return Error
        }
    }

    return Success
}
```
Note: Low S values are enforced for all signatures to avoid accidental signature
malleability.

### Core Programs

The Solana cluster genesis includes a list of special programs that provide
various core functionalities for the network. Historically these were referred
to as "native" programs and they used to be distributed together with the
validator code.

1. System Program

- Program id: `11111111111111111111111111111111`
- [Instructions](https://docs.rs/solana-program/latest/solana_program/system_instruction/enum.SystemInstruction.html)
- Create new accounts, allocate account data, assign accounts to owning
programs, transfer lamports from System Program owned accounts and pay
transaction fees.

2. Vote Program

- Program id: `Vote111111111111111111111111111111111111111`
- [Instructions](https://docs.rs/solana-vote-program/latest/solana_vote_program/vote_instruction/enum.VoteInstruction.html)
- Create and manage accounts that track validator voting state and rewards.

3. Stake Program

- Program id: `Stake11111111111111111111111111111111111111`
- [Instructions](https://docs.rs/solana-sdk/latest/solana_sdk/stake/instruction/enum.StakeInstruction.html)

- Add configuration data to the chain, followed by the list of public keys that
are allowed to modify it. Unlike the other programs, the Config program does
not define any individual instructions. It has just one implicit instruction:
"store". Its instruction data is a set of keys that gate access to the account
and the data to store inside of it.
