title: Reading from Network
description:
  Learn how to read data from the Solana blockchain network. This guide covers
  fetching wallet accounts, program accounts, and token mint accounts using
  JavaScript/TypeScript, with practical examples using the Solana web3.js
  library.
---

This guide explores how to read data from the Solana network by fetching
different accounts to understand the structure of a Solana account.

On Solana, all data exists in "accounts". You can think of data on Solana as a
public database with a single "Accounts" table, where each entry in this table
represents an individual account with the same base
[Account type](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/v2.1.11/sdk/account/src/lib.rs#L48-L60).

![Accounts](/assets/docs/core/accounts/accounts.png)

Accounts on Solana can store "state" or "executable" programs. Each account has
an "address" (public key) that serves as its unique ID used to locate its
corresponding on-chain data.

Solana accounts contain either:

- State: Data meant for reading and persistence. This includes information about
  tokens, user data, or other data defined within a program.
- Executable Programs: Accounts containing the actual code of Solana programs.
  These accounts store instructions that the network executes.

This separation of program code and program state forms a key feature of Solana's
Account Model. For more details, refer to the
[Solana Account Model](/docs/core/accounts) page.

## Fetch Playground Wallet

Next, you can look at a familiar account - your own Playground Wallet. This example
fetches this account and examines its structure to understand what a basic Solana
account looks like.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Open Example

Click this [link](https://beta.solpg.io/6671c5e5cffcf4b13384d198) to open the
example in Solana Playground. You'll see the following code:

```ts title="client.ts"
const address = pg.wallet.publicKey;
const accountInfo = await pg.connection.getAccountInfo(address);

console.log(JSON.stringify(accountInfo, null, 2));
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Explanation">

This code does three simple things:

- Gets your Playground wallet's address

  ```ts
  const address = pg.wallet.publicKey;
  ```

- Fetches the `AccountInfo` for the account at that address

  ```ts
  const accountInfo = await pg.connection.getAccountInfo(address);
  ```

- Prints out the `AccountInfo` to the Playground terminal

  ```ts
  console.log(JSON.stringify(accountInfo, null, 2));
  ```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

</Step>
<Step>

### Run Example

In the Playground terminal, type the _shell`run`_ command and hit enter:

```terminal
$ run
Running client...
  client.ts:
    {
  "data": {
    "type": "Buffer",
    "data": []
  },
  "executable": false,
  "lamports": 5000000000,
  "owner": "11111111111111111111111111111111",
  "rentEpoch": 18446744073709552000,
  "space": 0
}
```

When you run the code, you'll see the account details for your wallet displayed
in the terminal.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Explanation">

Your wallet appears as an account owned by the
[System Program](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/tree/v2.1.11/programs/system),
one of Solana's native programs. The main purpose of the wallet account involves
storing your SOL balance (amount in the `lamports` field).

At their core, all Solana accounts consist of bytes that deserialize into the same
base
[Account type](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/v2.1.11/sdk/account/src/lib.rs#L48-L60).

The fields in the output include:

- `data` - The field containing the account "data".
  For a wallet, this remains empty (0 bytes), but other accounts use this field to store
  arbitrary data as a serialized buffer of bytes.

- `executable` - A flag indicating whether the account functions as an executable
  program. For wallets and accounts that store state, this shows `false`.
- `owner` - The field showing which program controls the account. For wallets,
  the System Program always appears as the owner, with the address
  `11111111111111111111111111111111`.
- `lamports` - The account's balance in lamports (1 SOL = 1,000,000,000
  lamports).
- `rentEpoch` - A legacy field related to Solana's deprecated rent collection
  mechanism (currently unused).
- `space` - The byte capacity (length) of the `data` field (not a field in
  the `Account` type)

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Fetch Token Program

Next, this guide examines the Token Extensions program, an executable program for
interacting with tokens on Solana.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Open Example

Click this [link](https://beta.solpg.io/6671c6e7cffcf4b13384d199) to open the
example in Solana Playground. You'll see the following code:

```ts title="client.ts"
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

// !mark
const address = new PublicKey("TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb");
const accountInfo = await pg.connection.getAccountInfo(address);

console.log(JSON.stringify(accountInfo, null, 2));
```

Instead of fetching your Playground wallet, this example fetches the Token Extensions
Program account.

</Step>
<Step>

### Run Example

Run the code using the _shell`run`_ command in the terminal.

```terminal
$ run
Running client...
  client.ts:
    {
  "data": {
    "type": "Buffer",
    "data": [
      2,
      0,
      //... additional bytes
      86,
      51
    ]
  },
  "executable": true,
  "lamports": 1141440,
  "owner": "BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e11111111111111111111111",
  "rentEpoch": 18446744073709552000,
  "space": 36
}
```

Examine the output and how this program account differs from your wallet
account.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Explanation">

The Token Extensions program functions as an executable program account, maintaining 
the same `Account` structure.

Key differences from the output:

- `executable` - Set to `true`, indicating an executable program account.
- `data` - Contains serialized data (unlike the empty data in a wallet account).
  The data for a program account stores the address of another account (Program
  Executable Data Account) containing the program's bytecode.
- `owner` - The Upgradable Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) Loader
  (`BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e11111111111111111111111`) owns this account, functioning as a native program that manages
  executable accounts.

You can inspect the Solana Explorer for the
[Token Extensions Program Account](https://explorer.solana.com/address/TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb)
and its corresponding
[Program Executable Data Account](https://explorer.solana.com/address/DoU57AYuPFu2QU514RktNPG22QhApEjnKxnBcu4BHDTY).

The Program Executable Data Account contains the compiled bytecode for the Token
Extensions Program
[source code](https://github.com/solana-program/token-2022/tree/main/program).

## Fetch Mint Account

In this step, the guide examines a Mint account, which represents a unique token on
the Solana network.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Open Example

Click this [link](https://beta.solpg.io/6671c9aecffcf4b13384d19a) to open the
example in Solana Playground. You'll see the following code:

```ts title="client.ts"
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

// !mark
const address = new PublicKey("C33qt1dZGZSsqTrHdtLKXPZNoxs6U1ZBfyDkzmj6mXeR");
const accountInfo = await pg.connection.getAccountInfo(address);

console.log(JSON.stringify(accountInfo, null, 2));
```

In this example, the code fetches the address of an existing Mint account on devnet.

</Step>
<Step>

### Run Example

Run the code using the _shell`run`_ command.

```terminal
$ run
Running client...
  client.ts:
    {
  "data": {
    "type": "Buffer",
    "data": [
      1,
      0,
      //... additional bytes
      0,
      0
    ]
  },
  "executable": false,
  "lamports": 4176000,
  "owner": "TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb",
  "rentEpoch": 18446744073709552000,
  "space": 430
}
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Explanation">

Key differences from the output:

- `owner` - The Token Extensions program
  (`TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb`) owns the mint account.
- `executable` - Set to `false`, as this account stores state rather than
  executable code.
- `data`: Contains serialized data about the token (mint authority, supply,
  decimals, etc.).

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

</Step>
<Step>

### Deserialize Mint Account Data

An account's `data` field contains bytes requiring further deserialization
into the expected data type. The program that owns the account 
defines this data structure.

To help with deserialization, most program developers provide helper functions
in their client libraries that handle converting the raw bytes into the
appropriate data type.

<WithMentions>

For example, the _shell`@solana/spl-token`_ library provides functions like
[_ts`getMint()`_](mention:one) to help deserialize a token mint account's bytes
into the
[Mint](https://github.com/solana-program/token-2022/blob/rust-legacy%40v0.14.0/program/src/state.rs#L30-L44)
data type.

Open this next [example](https://beta.solpg.io/679d4c99cffcf4b13384d601) in
Solana Playground. You'll see the following code:

```ts title="client.ts"
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { getMint, TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID } from "@solana/spl-token";

const address = new PublicKey("C33qt1dZGZSsqTrHdtLKXPZNoxs6U1ZBfyDkzmj6mXeR");
// !mention one
const mintData = await getMint(
  pg.connection,
  address,
  "confirmed",
  TOKEN_2022_PROGRAM_ID,
);

// !collapse(1:17) collapsed
console.log(
  JSON.stringify(
    mintData,
    (key, value) => {
      // Convert BigInt to String
      if (typeof value === "bigint") {
        return value.toString();
      }
      // Handle Buffer objects
      if (Buffer.isBuffer(value)) {
        return `<Buffer ${value.toString("hex")}>`;
      }
      return value;
    },
    2,
  ),
);
```

</WithMentions>

This example uses the _ts`getMint()`_ helper function to automatically
deserialize the data field of the Mint account.

Run the code using the _shell`run`_ command.

```terminal
$ run
Running client...
  client.ts:
    {
  "address": "C33qt1dZGZSsqTrHdtLKXPZNoxs6U1ZBfyDkzmj6mXeR",
  "mintAuthority": "3z9vL1zjN6qyAFHhHQdWYRTFAcy69pJydkZmSFBKHg1R",
  "supply": "0",
  "decimals": 2,
  "isInitialized": true,
  "freezeAuthority": null,
  "tlvData": {
    "type": "Buffer",
    "data": [
      18,
      0,
      //... additional bytes
      0,
      0
    ]
  }
}
```

You should see the following deserialized Mint account data.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Explanation">

The `getMint` function deserializes the account data into the
[Mint](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/b1c44c171bc95e6ee74af12365cb9cbab68be76c/token/program/src/state.rs#L18-L32)
data type from the Token Extensions program source code.

- `address` - The Mint account's address
- `mintAuthority` - The authority allowed to mint new tokens
- `supply` - The total supply of tokens
- `decimals` - The number of decimal places for the token
- `isInitialized` - Whether the program initialized the Mint data
- `freezeAuthority` - The authority allowed to freeze token accounts
- `tlvData` - Extra data for Token Extensions (requires further
  deserialization)

You can view the fully deserialized
[Mint Account](https://explorer.solana.com/address/C33qt1dZGZSsqTrHdtLKXPZNoxs6U1ZBfyDkzmj6mXeR?cluster=devnet)
data, including enabled Token Extensions, on the Solana Explorer.
