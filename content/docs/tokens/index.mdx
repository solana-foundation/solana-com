title: Tokens on Solana
description: Learn about Solana's Token Programs.
---

Tokens are digital assets that represent ownership over diverse categories of
assets. Tokenization enables the digitalization of property rights. Tokens on
Solana are referred to as SPL
([Solana Program Library](https://github.com/solana-program)) Tokens.

This section covers the basics concepts of how tokens are represented on Solana.
Refer to the [SPL Token Basics](/docs/tokens/basics) section for code examples.

## Key Points

- [Token Programs](#token-program) contain all instruction logic for interacting
  with tokens on the network (both fungible and non-fungible).

- A [Mint Account](#mint-account) represents a specific token and stores global
  metadata about the token such as the total supply and mint authority (address
  authorized to create new units of a token).

- A [Token Account](#token-account) tracks individual ownership of tokens for a
  specific mint account for a specific owner.

- An [Associated Token Account](#associated-token-account) is a Token Account
  created with an address derived from the owner and mint account addresses.

## Token Programs

The Solana ecosystem has two main Token Programs. Source code for both programs
below.

Token Programs contains all instruction logic for interacting with tokens on the
network (both fungible and non-fungible). All tokens on Solana are effectively
[data accounts](/docs/core/accounts#data-account) owned by a Token Program.

![Token Program](/assets/docs/core/tokens/token-program.svg)

### Mint Account

Tokens on Solana are uniquely identified by the address of a
[Mint Account](https://github.com/solana-program/token/blob/6d18ff73b1dd30703a30b1ca941cb0f1d18c2b2a/program/src/state.rs#L16-L30)
owned by the Token Program. This account acts as a global counter for a specific
token and stores data such as:

- **Supply**: Total supply of the token
- **Decimals**: Decimal precision of the token
- **Mint authority**: The account authorized to create new units of the token,
  increasing the supply
- **Freeze authority**: The account authorized to freeze tokens in a Token
  Account, preventing them from being transferred or burned

![Mint Account](/assets/docs/core/tokens/mint-account.svg)

The full details stored on each Mint Account include the following:

```rust title="Mint Account State"
pub struct Mint {
    /// Optional authority used to mint new tokens. The mint authority may only
    /// be provided during mint creation. If no mint authority is present
    /// then the mint has a fixed supply and no further tokens may be
    /// minted.
    pub mint_authority: COption<Pubkey>,
    /// Total supply of tokens.
    pub supply: u64,
    /// Number of base 10 digits to the right of the decimal place.
    pub decimals: u8,
    /// Is `true` if this structure has been initialized
    pub is_initialized: bool,
    /// Optional authority to freeze token accounts.
    pub freeze_authority: COption<Pubkey>,
}
```

For reference, here is a Solana Explorer link to the
[USDC Mint Account](https://explorer.solana.com/address/EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v).

### Token Account

The Token Program creates
[Token Accounts](https://github.com/solana-program/token/blob/6d18ff73b1dd30703a30b1ca941cb0f1d18c2b2a/program/src/state.rs#L87-L108)
to track individual ownership of each token unit. A Token Account stores data
such as:

- **Mint**: The token the Token Account holds units of
- **Owner**: The account authorized to transfer tokens from the Token Account
- **Amount**: Number of the tokens the Token Account currently holds

![Token Account](/assets/docs/core/tokens/token-account.svg)

The full details stored on each Token Account include the following:

```rust title="Token Account State"
pub struct Account {
    /// The mint associated with this account
    pub mint: Pubkey,
    /// The owner of this account.
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    /// The amount of tokens this account holds.
    pub amount: u64,
    /// If `delegate` is `Some` then `delegated_amount` represents
    /// the amount authorized by the delegate
    pub delegate: COption<Pubkey>,
    /// The account's state
    pub state: AccountState,
    /// If is_native.is_some, this is a native token, and the value logs the
    /// rent-exempt reserve. An Account is required to be rent-exempt, so
    /// the value is used by the Processor to ensure that wrapped SOL
    /// accounts do not drop below this threshold.
    pub is_native: COption<u64>,
    /// The amount delegated
    pub delegated_amount: u64,
    /// Optional authority to close the account.
    pub close_authority: COption<Pubkey>,
}
```

A wallet needs a token account for each token (mint) it wants to hold, with the
wallet address set as the token account owner. Each wallet can own multiple
token accounts for the same token (mint), but a token account can only have one
owner and hold units of one token (mint).

![Account Relationship](/assets/docs/core/tokens/token-account-relationship.svg)

<Callout type="info">

Note that each Token Account's data includes an `owner` field identifying who
has authority over the Token Account. This differs from the program owner
specified in the base [Account](/docs/core/accounts#account-type) type, which is
the Token Program for all Token Accounts.

</Callout>

### Associated Token Account

Associated Token Accounts simplify the process of finding a token account's
address for a specific mint and owner. Think of the Associated Token Account as
the "default" token account for a specific mint and owner.

An Associated Token Account is created with an address derived from the owner's
address and the mint account's address. It's important to understand that an
Associated Token Account is just a token account with a specific address.

This introduces a key concept in Solana development:
[Program Derived Address (PDA)](/docs/core/pda). A PDA derives an address
deterministically using predefined inputs, making it easy to find the address of
an account.

![Associated Token Account](/assets/docs/core/tokens/associated-token-account.svg)

Note that each wallet needs its own token account to hold tokens from the same
mint.

![Accounts Relationship Expanded](/assets/docs/core/tokens/token-account-relationship-ata.svg)

## Token CLI Examples

The _sh`spl-token`_ CLI can be used to experiment with SPL tokens. In the
examples below, we'll use the [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/)
terminal to run the CLI commands directly in the browser without having to
install the CLI locally.

Creating tokens and accounts requires SOL for account rent deposits and
transaction fees. If it is your first time using Solana Playground, created a
Playground wallet and run the _sh`solana airdrop`_ command in the Playground
terminal. You can also get devnet SOL using the public
[web faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/).

```terminal
$ solana airdrop 2
```

Run _sh`spl-token --help`_ for a full description of available commands.

```terminal
$ spl-token --help
```

Alternatively, you can install the _sh`spl-token`_ CLI locally using the
following command.

```terminal
$ cargo install spl-token-cli
```

You can find additional examples on the CLI in the _sh`spl-token`_
[documentation](https://www.solana-program.com/docs/token).

<Callout type="info">

In the following sections, the account addresses displayed when you run the CLI
command will differ from the example output shown below. Please use the
addresses output in your Playground terminal when following along. For example,
the address output from the _sh`create-token`_ command is a mint account with
your Playground wallet set as the mint authority.

</Callout>

### Create a New Token

To create a new token (mint account) run the following command in the Solana
Playground terminal.

```terminal
$ spl-token create-token
```

You should see an output similar to the following below. You can inspect both
the token and transaction details on
[Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet) using the output
_sh`Address`_ and _sh`Signature`_.

In the example output below, the unique identifier (address) of the new token
(mint) is `99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg`.

```sh title="Terminal Output"
Creating token 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg

Address:  99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg
Decimals:  9

Signature: 44fvKfT1ezBUwdzrCys3fvCdFxbLMnNvBstds76QZyE6cXag5NupBprSXwxPTzzjrC3cA6nvUZaLFTvmcKyzxrm1
```

A new mint account initially has no supply. You can check the current supply of
a token using the following command:

```terminal
$ spl-token supply <TOKEN_ADDRESS>
```

Running the _sh`supply`_ command for a newly created token will return a value
of `0`:

```sh title="Example"
spl-token supply 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg
```

Under the hood, creating a new Mint Account requires sending a transaction with
two instructions. Here is a Javascript example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660ce32ecffcf4b13384d00f).

1. Invoke the System Program to create a new account with enough space for the
   Mint Account data and then transfer ownership to the Token Program.

2. Invoke the Token Program to initialize the data of the new account as a Mint
   Account

### Create Token Account

To hold units of a particular token (mint), you must first create a token
account. To create a new token account, use the following command:

```terminal
$ spl-token create-account <TOKEN_ADDRESS>
```

For example, running the following command in the Solana Playground terminal:

```sh title="Example"
spl-token create-account 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg
```

Returns the following output:

- `AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9` is the address of the token
  account created to hold units of the token specified in the
  _sh`create-account`_ command.

```sh title="Terminal Output"
Creating account AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9

Signature: 2BtrynuCLX9CNofFiaw6Yzbx6hit66pup9Sk7aFjwU2NEbFz7NCHD9w9sWhrCfEd73XveAGK1DxFpJoQZPXU9tS1
```

By default the _sh`create-account`_ command creates an associated token account
with your wallet address as the token account owner.

You can create a token account with a different owner using the following
command.

```terminal
$ spl-token create-account --owner <OWNER_ADDRESS> <TOKEN_ADDRESS>
```

Note the `<TOKEN_ADDRESS>` is the address of the mint account you want to create
a token account for.

For example, running the following command:

```sh title="Example"
spl-token create-account --owner 2i3KvjDCZWxBsqcxBHpdEaZYQwQSYE6LXUMx5VjY5XrR 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg
```

Returns the following output:

- `Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt` is the address of the token
  account created to hold units of the token specified in the
  _sh`create-account`_ command (`99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg`)
  and owned by the address specified following the _sh`--owner`_ flag
  (`2i3KvjDCZWxBsqcxBHpdEaZYQwQSYE6LXUMx5VjY5XrR`). This is useful when you need
  to create a token account for another user.

```shell title="Terminal Output" /Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt/
Creating account Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt

Signature: 44vqKdfzspT592REDPY4goaRJH3uJ3Ce13G4BCuUHg35dVUbHuGTHvqn4ZjYF9BGe9QrjMfe9GmuLkQhSZCBQuEt
```

Under the hood, creating an Associated Token Account requires a single
instruction that invokes the
[Associated Token Program](https://github.com/solana-program/associated-token-account).
Here is a Javascript example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660ce868cffcf4b13384d011).

The Associated Token Program uses [Cross Program Invocations](/docs/core/cpi) to
handle:

- [Invoking the System Program](https://github.com/solana-program/associated-token-account/blob/9d94201e8158f06015ff80ad47fefac62a2ec450/program/src/tools/account.rs#L19)
  to create a new account using the provided PDA as the address of the new
  account
- [Invoking the Token Program](https://github.com/solana-program/associated-token-account/blob/9d94201e8158f06015ff80ad47fefac62a2ec450/program/src/processor.rs#L138-L161)
  to initialize the Token Account data for the new account.

Alternatively, creating a new Token Account using a randomly new keypair (not an
Associated Token Account) requires sending a transaction with two instructions.
Here is a Javascript example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660ce716cffcf4b13384d010).

1. Invoke the System Program to create a new account with enough space for the
   Token Account data and then transfer ownership to the Token Program.

2. Invoke the Token Program to initialize the data of the new account as a Token
   Account

### Mint Tokens

To create new units of a token, use the following command:

```terminal
$ spl-token mint [OPTIONS] <TOKEN_ADDRESS> <TOKEN_AMOUNT> [--] [RECIPIENT_TOKEN_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS]
```

For example, running the following command:

```sh title="Example"
spl-token mint 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg 100
```

Returns the following output:

- `99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg` is the address of the mint
  account that tokens are being minted for (increasing total supply).

- `AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9` is the address of your wallet's
  token account that units of the token are being minted to (increasing amount).

```shell title="Terminal Output"
Minting 100 tokens
  Token: 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg
  Recipient: AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9

Signature: 2NJ1m7qCraPSBAVxbr2ssmWZmBU9Jc8pDtJAnyZsZJRcaYCYMqq1oRY1gqA4ddQno3g3xcnny5fzr1dvsnFKMEqG
```

To mint tokens to a different token account, specify the address of the intended
recipient token account. For example, running the following command:

```sh title="Example"
spl-token mint 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg 100 -- Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt
```

Returns the following output:

- `99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg` is the address of the mint
  account that tokens are being minted for (increasing total supply).

- `Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt` is the address of the token
  account that units of the token are being minted to (increasing amount).

```shell title="Terminal Output" /99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg/ /Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt/
Minting 100 tokens
  Token: 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg
  Recipient: Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt

Signature: 3SQvNM3o9DsTiLwcEkSPT1Edr14RgE2wC54TEjonEP2swyVCp2jPWYWdD6RwXUGpvDNUkKWzVBZVFShn5yntxVd7
```

Under the hood, creating new units of a token requires invoking the _rs`MintTo`_
instruction on the Token Program. This instruction must be signed by the mint
authority. The instruction mints new units of the token to a Token Account and
increases the total supply on the Mint Account. Here is a Javascript example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660cea45cffcf4b13384d012).

### Transfer Tokens

To transfer units of a token between two token accounts, use the following
command:

```sh title="Terminal"
spl-token transfer [OPTIONS] <TOKEN_ADDRESS> <TOKEN_AMOUNT> <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS
or RECIPIENT_TOKEN_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
```

For example, running the following command:

```sh title="Example"
spl-token transfer 99zqUzQGohamfYxyo8ykTEbi91iom3CLmwCA75FK5zTg 100 Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt
```

Returns the following output:

- `AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9` is the address of the token
  account that tokens are being transferred from. This would be the address of
  your token account for the specified token being transferred.

- `Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt` is the address of the token
  account that tokens are being transferred to.

```shell title="Terminal Output"
Transfer 100 tokens
  Sender: AfB7uwBEsGtrrBqPTVqEgzWed5XdYfM1psPNLmf7EeX9
  Recipient: Hmyk3FSw4cfsuAes7sanp2oxSkE9ivaH6pMzDzbacqmt

Signature: 5y6HVwV8V2hHGLTVmTmdySRiEUCZnWmkasAvJ7J6m7JR46obbGKCBqUFgLpZu5zQGwM4Xy6GZ4M5LKd1h6Padx3o
```

Under the hood, transferring tokens requires invoking the _rs`Transfer`_
instruction on the Token Program. This instruction must be signed by the owner
of the sender's Token Account. The instruction transfers units of a token from
one Token Account to another Token Account. Here is a Javascript example on
[Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/660ced84cffcf4b13384d013).

It's important to understand that both the sender and recipient must have
existing token accounts for the specific type of token being transferred. The
sender can include additional instructions on the transaction to create the
recipient's token account, which generally is the Associated Token Account.

### Create Token Metadata

The Token Extensions Program enables additional customizable metadata (such as
name, symbol, link to image) to be stored directly on the Mint Account.

To create a new token with the metadata extension enabled, using the following
command:

```sh title="Example"
spl-token create-token --program-id TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb
--enable-metadata
```

The command returns the following output:

- `BdhzpzhTD1MFqBiwNdrRy4jFo2FHFufw3n9e8sVjJczP` is the address of the new token
  created with the metadata extension enabled.

```shell title="Terminal Output"
Creating token BdhzpzhTD1MFqBiwNdrRy4jFo2FHFufw3n9e8sVjJczP under program TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb
To initialize metadata inside the mint, please run `spl-token initialize-metadata BdhzpzhTD1MFqBiwNdrRy4jFo2FHFufw3n9e8sVjJczP <YOUR_TOKEN_NAME> <YOUR_TOKEN_SYMBOL> <YOUR_TOKEN_URI>`, and sign with the mint authority.

Address:  BdhzpzhTD1MFqBiwNdrRy4jFo2FHFufw3n9e8sVjJczP
Decimals:  9

Signature: 5iQofFeXdYhMi9uTzZghcq8stAaa6CY6saUwcdnELST13eNSifiuLbvR5DnRt311frkCTUh5oecj8YEvZSB3wfai
```

Once a new token is created with the metadata extension enabled, use the
following command to initialize the metadata.

```sh title="Terminal"
spl-token initialize-metadata <TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS> <YOUR_TOKEN_NAME>
<YOUR_TOKEN_SYMBOL> <YOUR_TOKEN_URI>
```

The token URI is normally a link to offchain metadata you want to associate with
the token. You can find an example of the JSON format
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solana-developers/opos-asset/main/assets/DeveloperPortal/metadata.json).

For example, running the following command will store the additional metadata
directly on the specified mint account:

```sh title="Example"
spl-token initialize-metadata BdhzpzhTD1MFqBiwNdrRy4jFo2FHFufw3n9e8sVjJczP "TokenName" "TokenSymbol" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solana-developers/opos-asset/main/assets/DeveloperPortal/metadata.json"
```

You can then look up the address of the mint account on an explorer to inspect
the metadata. For example, here is a token created with the metadata extension
enabled on the
[Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/address/BdhzpzhTD1MFqBiwNdrRy4jFo2FHFufw3n9e8sVjJczP?cluster=devnet).

You can learn more on the
[Metadata Extension Guide](/developers/guides/token-extensions/metadata-pointer).
For more details related to various Token Extensions, refer to the Token
Extensions
[Getting Started Guide](/developers/guides/token-extensions/getting-started) and
the
[SPL documentation](https://www.solana-program.com/docs/token-2022/extensions).
