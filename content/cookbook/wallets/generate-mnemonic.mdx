One way to generate a Keypair is through the use of a Mnemonic. Mnemonics are
generally used to make the user experience within wallets better than a Keypair
file by using a list of readable words (instead of a shorter string of random
numbers and letters).

```typescript !! title="Typescript"
import * as bip39 from "bip39";

const mnemonic = bip39.generateMnemonic();
console.log(mnemonic);
```

```rust !! title="Rust"
use anyhow::Result;
// https://crates.io/crates/tiny-bip39
use bip39::{Language, Mnemonic, MnemonicType};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let mnemonic = Mnemonic::new(MnemonicType::Words12, Language::English);
    let phrase = mnemonic.phrase();

    println!("phrase: {}", phrase);
    Ok(())
}
```
