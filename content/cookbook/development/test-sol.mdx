title: Getting Test SOL
description:
  Learn how to get test SOL for development purposes by requesting an airdrop in
  your source code.
---

When you're working locally, you need some SOL in order to send transactions. In
non-mainnet environments you can receive SOL by airdropping it to your address:

```typescript !! title="gill"
import {
  address,
  lamports,
  airdropFactory,
  createSolanaClient,
  LAMPORTS_PER_SOL
} from "gill";

const { rpc, rpcSubscriptions, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = createSolanaClient(
  {
    urlOrMoniker: "http://127.0.0.1:8899" // or `localnet`, etc
  }
);

const wallet = address("nick6zJc6HpW3kfBm4xS2dmbuVRyb5F3AnUvj5ymzR5");

const { value: initialBalance } = await rpc.getBalance(wallet).send();
console.log("Initial balance:", initialBalance);

/**
 * Note: the `devnet` and `testnet` clusters are subject to rate limits.
 * it is strongly recommended to use `localnet` and the local test validator
 */
await airdropFactory({ rpc, rpcSubscriptions })({
  commitment: "confirmed",
  lamports: lamports(BigInt(LAMPORTS_PER_SOL)), // request 1 SOL airdrop
  recipientAddress: wallet
});

const { value: newBalance } = await rpc.getBalance(wallet).send();
console.log("New balance:", newBalance);
```

```typescript !! title="web3.js"
import { Connection, PublicKey, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL } from "@solana/web3.js";

const connection = new Connection("http://127.0.0.1:8899", "confirmed");

const wallet = new PublicKey("nick6zJc6HpW3kfBm4xS2dmbuVRyb5F3AnUvj5ymzR5");

/**
 * Note: the `devnet` and `testnet` clusters are subject to rate limits.
 * it is strongly recommended to use `localnet` and the local test validator
 */
const signature = await connection.requestAirdrop(wallet, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL); // request 1 SOL airdrop

const { blockhash, lastValidBlockHeight } =
  await connection.getLatestBlockhash();

// note: confirming the airdrop transaction is very important to ensure the wallet has
await connection.confirmTransaction({
  blockhash,
  lastValidBlockHeight,
  signature
});
```
