# What is Staking?

Staking on Solana represents a profound shift in how financial infrastructure operates and who benefits from it. In traditional capital markets, the entities running the infrastructure - exchanges, clearinghouses, settlement systems - capture enormous value while limiting access to their services. Through staking, Solana distributes both the responsibility and rewards of running internet capital markets to anyone holding SOL, creating aligned incentives between users and infrastructure.

This democratization of infrastructure ownership embodies Solana's vision. Rather than a few corporations controlling market access and extracting fees, thousands of validators worldwide process transactions while millions of stakers share in the rewards. You're not just earning yield; you're participating in securing the rails on which global finance increasingly runs. Your staked SOL directly contributes to the network's security and decentralization.

Understanding Proof of Stake reveals why this matters for internet capital markets. Traditional financial systems rely on legal frameworks and corporate trust. Solana uses economic incentives and cryptographic proofs. Validators stake SOL as a security deposit, ensuring honest behavior because malicious actions would destroy their own value. This creates a self-securing system that needs no central authority - perfect infrastructure for truly global, permissionless markets.

The staking process on Solana prioritizes accessibility. Unlike mining which requires specialized hardware and technical expertise, staking only requires holding SOL. You delegate to professional validators who handle the technical operations, while you share in the rewards. This inclusive design means a teacher in Thailand and a hedge fund in New York participate in the same system on equal terms. Geography, connections, and accreditation requirements become irrelevant.

Current staking returns of 5-7% annually might seem modest compared to some flashier investment promises, but they represent something profound: sustainable rewards for securing global financial infrastructure. These aren't speculative returns dependent on complex schemes. They're the digital equivalent of owning shares in the stock exchange, clearing system, and settlement network combined - except accessible to everyone, not just wealthy investors.

Choosing validators becomes an exercise in decentralized governance. By delegating to reliable, performant validators, you strengthen the network. By avoiding centralized exchanges' staking services, you promote decentralization. Your staking decisions directly impact the security and resilience of internet capital markets. This responsibility comes with power - unlike traditional finance where infrastructure decisions happen in boardrooms, Solana stakers vote with their delegations.

The innovation of liquid staking demonstrates how internet capital markets improve on traditional finance. In the old world, investing in infrastructure locks up your money. On Solana, liquid staking gives you tokens representing your staked SOL that you can still use elsewhere. You can secure the network while simultaneously using that same value for trading, lending, or other opportunities. This efficient use of capital was impossible before programmable finance.

Risk consideration in staking reflects the maturing of internet capital markets. While slashing (penalizing validators for misbehavior) isn't yet active on Solana, understanding these mechanisms prepares you for the full vision. In developed markets, your staking rewards come with responsibility to choose validators wisely. Poor validator performance means missed rewards. This creates market dynamics where the best validators attract more stake, improving overall network quality.

The unstaking period of 2-3 days might seem inconvenient compared to instant liquidity, but it serves crucial purposes. This cooldown prevents certain attacks on the network and ensures stability during volatile periods. Consider it similar to settlement periods in traditional finance, but instead of enriching intermediaries, the delay protects all network participants. For those needing immediate liquidity, liquid staking provides alternatives.

By staking SOL, you join a global community building alternative financial infrastructure. Your rewards don't come from extracting value from users through fees or spreads. They come from providing genuine utility - securing a network that enables instant, low-cost, permissionless access to capital markets. Every epoch that passes, every reward earned, represents progress toward a financial system that serves everyone, not just the privileged few.

Staking isn't passive income - it's active participation in revolutionizing how global finance operates. Your staked SOL says you believe in internet capital markets accessible to all 5.5 billion internet users, not just accredited investors in wealthy nations.
