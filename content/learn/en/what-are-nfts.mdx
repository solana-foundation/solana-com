# What are NFTs?

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique digital assets that represent ownership of specific items. Unlike regular tokens where each unit is identical and interchangeable, each NFT is one-of-a-kind. This chapter explains how NFTs work on Solana and their various uses beyond digital art.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:
- What makes NFTs different from regular tokens
- Common uses for NFTs today
- How to buy, sell, and store NFTs safely
- Costs and technical aspects on Solana
- How to evaluate NFT projects

## Understanding Non-Fungible


The key difference:

**Fungible (Regular Tokens)**
- Each unit is identical
- Interchangeable
- Like currency or shares
- Example: 1 USDC = any other 1 USDC

**Non-Fungible (NFTs)**
- Each one is unique
- Not interchangeable
- Like collectibles or property
- Example: Each piece of art is different

## Common NFT Use Cases


### Digital Art and Collectibles
Artists create unique or limited edition digital artwork.
- Direct artist-to-collector sales
- Royalties on secondary sales
- Verifiable authenticity
- Global marketplace access

### Gaming Assets
In-game items with real ownership.
- Trade items between players
- Use across compatible games
- Retain value outside the game
- True digital property rights

### Music and Media
Musicians and creators tokenize their work.
- Direct fan support
- Royalty distribution
- Exclusive content access
- New monetization models

### Event Tickets
Digital tickets that prevent fraud.
- Verifiable authenticity
- Built-in resale controls
- Collectible after events
- Direct from organizers

### Memberships and Access
Token-gated communities and services.
- Transferable memberships
- Tiered access levels
- Community governance
- Exclusive benefits

### Technical Structure
1. **Metadata**: Information about the NFT (name, image, traits)
2. **Mint Account**: Unique identifier on Solana
3. **Token Account**: Shows current owner
4. **Associated Files**: Usually stored off-chain (IPFS, Arweave)

### Why Solana for NFTs?
- **Low Costs**: Mint for ~$0.50 vs $50-200 on other chains
- **Fast Transactions**: Instant transfers and purchases
- **Compressed NFTs**: Even cheaper for large collections
- **Active Ecosystem**: Vibrant marketplaces and communities

### Research Before Buying
- **Team**: Who created it? Are they public?
- **Community**: Active Discord/Twitter?
- **Utility**: What benefits come with ownership?
- **Roadmap**: Future plans and deliverables
- **Volume**: Trading activity and liquidity

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Anonymous teams with no history
- Promises of guaranteed profits
- Pressure to buy immediately
- Copied art or concepts
- No clear utility or purpose

## NFT Costs on Solana


### Typical Fees
- **Minting**: ~0.01 SOL ($0.50-1.00)
- **Buying**: Marketplace fee (2-3%) + network fee
- **Listing**: Usually free
- **Transferring**: ~0.000005 SOL ($0.0005)

### Compressed NFTs
For large-scale use cases:
- 1000x cheaper than regular NFTs
- Perfect for gaming items
- Same ownership benefits
- Slightly different technical structure

## Storing and Managing NFTs


### Wallet Display
Most Solana wallets automatically:
- Show your NFT collection
- Display images and metadata
- Track floor prices
- Enable easy transfers

### Best Practices
1. **Use trusted wallets**
2. **Verify before buying** (check official links)
3. **Be cautious of DMs** (scammers impersonate projects)
4. **Consider hardware wallets** for valuable collections
5. **Understand what you own** (art â‰  copyright)

## Creating NFTs

3. Create metadata file
4. Mint on Solana
5. List on marketplaces

### Platforms for Creators
- Technical standards for NFT creation
- Creator-friendly minting tools
- Art-focused marketplace platforms

## Common Questions

### Do I own the copyright?
Usually no. NFT ownership typically means you own that specific token, not copyright to the underlying art.

### Can NFTs be copied?
The image can be copied, but the verified ownership on Solana cannot be duplicated.

### Why do people buy NFTs?
Reasons vary: supporting artists, community membership, speculation, gaming utility, or collecting.

### Are NFTs a good investment?
NFT values can be highly volatile. Many lose value. Only invest what you can afford to lose.

## What's Next

Now that you understand NFTs, the next chapter explores the broader Solana ecosystem. You'll learn how to discover and evaluate different applications, from DeFi protocols to gaming platforms.

Remember: NFTs are tools that enable new forms of digital ownership and community. Focus on projects with real utility or personal meaning rather than purely speculative investments.
