# What are NFTs?

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique digital assets that represent ownership of
specific items. Unlike regular tokens where each unit is identical and
interchangeable, each NFT is one-of-a-kind. This chapter explains how NFTs work
on Solana and their various uses beyond digital art.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:

- What makes NFTs different from regular tokens
- Common uses for NFTs today
- How NFTs work technically on Solana
- The process of creating NFTs
- Storage and management basics

## Understanding Non-Fungible

The key difference:

**Fungible (Regular Tokens)**

- Each unit is identical
- Interchangeable
- Like currency or shares
- Example: 1 USDC = any other 1 USDC

**Non-Fungible (NFTs)**

- Each one is unique
- Not interchangeable
- Like collectibles or property
- Example: Each piece of art is different

## Common NFT Use Cases

### Digital Art and Collectibles

Artists create unique or limited edition digital artwork.

- Direct artist-to-collector sales
- Royalties on secondary sales
- Verifiable authenticity
- Global marketplace access

### Gaming Assets

In-game items with real ownership.

- Trade items between players
- Use across compatible games
- Retain value outside the game
- True digital property rights

### Music and Media

Musicians and creators tokenize their work.

- Direct fan support
- Royalty distribution
- Exclusive content access
- New monetization models

### Event Tickets

Digital tickets that prevent fraud.

- Verifiable authenticity
- Built-in resale controls
- Collectible after events
- Direct from organizers

### Memberships and Access

Token-gated communities and services.

- Transferable memberships
- Tiered access levels
- Community governance
- Exclusive benefits

## How NFTs Work on Solana

### Technical Structure

1. **Metadata**: Information about the NFT (name, image, traits)
2. **Mint Account**: Unique identifier on Solana
3. **Token Account**: Shows current owner
4. **Associated Files**: Usually stored off-chain (IPFS, Arweave)

### Why Solana for NFTs?

- **Low Costs**: Mint for ~$0.50 compared to much higher costs elsewhere
- **Fast Transactions**: Instant transfers and purchases
- **Compressed NFTs**: Even cheaper for large collections
- **Active Ecosystem**: Vibrant marketplaces and communities

## NFT Costs on Solana

### Typical Fees

- **Minting**: ~0.01 SOL ($0.50-1.00)
- **Buying**: Marketplace fee (2-3%) + network fee
- **Listing**: Usually free
- **Transferring**: ~0.000005 SOL ($0.0005)

### Compressed NFTs

For large-scale use cases:

- 1000x cheaper than regular NFTs
- Perfect for gaming items
- Same ownership benefits
- Slightly different technical structure

## Storing and Managing NFTs

### Wallet Display

Most Solana wallets automatically:

- Show your NFT collection
- Display images and metadata
- Organize by collection
- Enable easy transfers

### Best Practices

1. **Use trusted wallets**
2. **Verify authenticity** (check official sources)
3. **Be cautious of DMs** (avoid impersonators)
4. **Consider hardware wallets** for important collections
5. **Understand ownership rights** (owning an NFT â‰  copyright)

## Creating NFTs

### Basic Process

1. Create or obtain digital content
2. Upload to storage (IPFS/Arweave)
3. Create metadata file
4. Mint on Solana
5. List on marketplaces

### Platforms for Creators

- Technical standards for NFT creation
- Creator-friendly minting tools
- Art-focused marketplace platforms

## Common Questions

### Do I own the copyright?

Usually no. NFT ownership typically means you own that specific token, not
copyright to the underlying art.

### Can NFTs be copied?

The image can be copied, but the verified ownership on Solana cannot be
duplicated.

### What are NFTs used for?

NFTs enable digital ownership for art, gaming items, event tickets, memberships,
and collectibles. They provide creators new ways to connect with their audience.

### How are NFTs different from regular files?

While anyone can copy a digital file, NFTs provide verifiable ownership and
authenticity on Solana, creating scarcity and provenance for digital items.

## What's Next

Now that you understand NFTs as unique digital assets, the next chapter explores
the broader Solana ecosystem. You'll learn about different types of applications
and how they leverage Solana's speed and low costs.

NFTs demonstrate how digital ownership works on Solana, enabling everything from
digital art to gaming assets to event tickets.
