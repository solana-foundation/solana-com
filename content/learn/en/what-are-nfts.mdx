# What are NFTs?

Non-Fungible Tokens represent the expansion of internet capital markets beyond commoditized assets to unique property rights. While traditional capital markets excel at trading fungible assets - identical shares of stock or bonds - they struggle with unique assets requiring individual verification and transfer. NFTs on Solana solve this at internet scale, enabling global markets for everything from digital art to real estate, intellectual property to identity credentials.

The breakthrough isn't just digital ownership - it's making unique assets as liquid and tradeable as commodities. In traditional markets, selling unique assets like art, real estate, or collectibles involves intermediaries, authentication processes, and significant friction. NFTs on Solana can be verified, transferred, and settled in seconds for pennies. This transformation makes previously illiquid assets part of accessible capital markets.

Solana's approach to NFTs embodies its internet capital markets vision through radical cost reduction. While NFTs on Ethereum can cost hundreds of dollars to create and transfer, Solana NFTs cost cents. This isn't just about saving money - it fundamentally changes what's possible. Game developers can give every item real ownership. Artists can experiment without prohibitive costs. Businesses can tokenize operations previously too small to justify traditional contracts.

The technology powering Solana NFTs showcases infrastructure built for scale. Compressed NFTs reduce costs by up to 1000x through clever cryptographic techniques, making it feasible to create millions of NFTs for gaming or enterprise use. This isn't theoretical - games on Solana already feature entire economies where every sword, potion, and character is a tradeable NFT. The same infrastructure that enables gaming economies can tokenize real-world supply chains.

Understanding NFT utility reveals their role in democratizing market access. Yes, profile picture collections garnered attention, but the deeper revolution is functional NFTs. Music NFTs where artists sell directly to fans, cutting out record labels. Event tickets that can't be counterfeited and naturally prevent scalping. Membership tokens replacing subscriptions with tradeable access rights. Each use case removes traditional gatekeepers while creating new markets.

The flexibility of NFTs within Solana's ecosystem multiplies their impact. Your gaming NFT can be used as collateral for a loan. Your music NFT can generate streaming income deposited directly to your wallet. Your membership NFT can grant access across multiple platforms. This ability to use assets in multiple ways, impossible in traditional separated systems, creates compound value as internet capital markets mature.

NFT marketplaces on Solana demonstrate the user experience possible when infrastructure doesn't limit innovation. Browse collections with sub-second load times. Execute trades that settle immediately. Pay fees so low they're negligible. The experience matches or exceeds traditional e-commerce, but with crucial advantages: global access, no payment processor restrictions, and true ownership of purchased items.

The cultural impact of NFTs extends beyond speculation to fundamental questions about value and ownership in digital economies. As more life moves online, the ability to provably own digital assets becomes crucial. NFTs provide the property rights layer for the internet, enabling creators to capture value from their work and users to build portable digital wealth. This isn't about JPEGs - it's about economic rights in virtual worlds.

Safety in NFT markets requires understanding both technology and human nature. Verify collection authenticity through official channels, not just marketplace checkmarks. Understand what rights come with NFT ownership - owning an NFT doesn't always include commercial rights to the underlying content. Be skeptical of promises about future utility or returns. The permissionless nature of NFT creation means due diligence falls on buyers.

The trajectory of NFTs points toward tokenizing unique value everywhere. Real estate NFTs enabling fractional ownership of properties globally. Intellectual property NFTs ensuring creators and inventors get paid. Identity NFTs providing portable, verifiable credentials. Carbon credit NFTs creating transparent environmental markets. Each category adds depth to internet capital markets while removing traditional friction.

NFTs on Solana represent more than collectibles - they're the infrastructure for unique asset markets accessible to anyone online. By reducing costs to near zero while maintaining security and speed, Solana enables NFT use cases impossible elsewhere. Every NFT minted, traded, and utilized builds toward a future where all property rights - physical and digital - can participate in efficient global markets.

Your participation in NFT markets isn't just collecting - it's helping establish the property rights framework for the internet age.
