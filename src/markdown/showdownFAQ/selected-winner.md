Winners of the NFT Showdown will have the unique opportunity to work with Solana Foundation team and industry mentors on refining their business plans. It is important to note that being selected as a winner means that you have a promising pitch idea and we are giving you an opportunity to work with individuals with industry know-how to take it to the next level. It does not mean the Solana Foundation is endorsing your company or blessing your mint.
