_Welcome to No Bad Questions, a series that helps answer some basic questions
about blockchain, crypto, and web3._

Earlier this year, the Solana Labs team
announced [Solana Pay](https://solana.com/news/solana-pay-announcement), a new
protocol for payments on Solana. It’s exciting news!

... unless you’re one of the many, many people who have no idea what it means.
For merchants and consumers alike, that announcement might as well be another
language. What are payments on Solana? Does that just mean paying with crypto?

Not even close. Payments in the crypto space is a new, exciting way to exchange
for goods and services. But don’t worry — there are no bad questions. After
doing some research and talking to Sheraz Shere, head of payments at Solana
Labs, we have the answers. Let’s break it down.

## What exactly are “digital payments”?

TLDR: Digital payments use digital currencies to pay for goods and services.

## Does this just mean paying for things with cryptocurrency?

Not exactly, says Shere. “This is about building a new set of payment and
commerce rails for merchants,” he says, “that _happen_ to use the blockchain.” \
\
While there are plenty of tools that people can use to pay for real-life items
and goods with cryptocurrency, blockchain payments mean that people can use the
underlying technology for more secure payments without intermediaries.

## Wait, stablecoins? What are those?

Digital currency refers to a range of different, digital-native tokens. You’ve
probably heard of several of them like sol (on Solana), bitcoin and ether (on
Ethereum). The Solana ecosystem also has a number of other tokens built on top
of it.

Some of these tokens that are built on Solana, like USDC or USDT, are linked to
the US dollar. They’re called _stablecoins_, and being linked to the dollar
allows them to remain stable against fluctuations. That way you don’t
spend [10,000 BTC on a pizza](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/22/10-years-after-laszlo-hanyecz-bought-pizza-with-10k-bitcoin-he-has-no-regrets/)
, only for it to become much more valuable a decade later!

## How is this different from traditional digital payment systems, like Venmo or a credit card?

Think of it as a digital version of cash.

The entire digital financial system is built on intermediaries, says Shere.
Payment systems like Venmo insert themselves between consumers and merchants,
adding fees and slowing down the process. Blockchain payments, on the other
hand, simplify that to a singular, one to one interaction.

Digital payments are “all about direct connection with the consumer to settle
the funds instantly and fast,” he says, “and with virtually no cost for the
consumer.”

## What is “Solana Pay”?

Solana Pay is a protocol that allows people to pay with tokens by scanning a
simple QR code. Anyone can set it up in their place of business or use it to
create their own payments program!

## What do you mean by wallet?

To do anything with digital payments, you need to set up a digital wallet. There
are several great options in the Solana ecosystem, and they’re easy to set up!
Some, like Phantom, already had Solana Pay integrated.

## Okay, so what exactly can you do with payments that use blockchain?

In addition to removing the fees and slowdowns associated with intermediaries,
building a payments structure on the blockchain is really about creating a one
on one connection between you and someone you’re purchasing something from. And
once you think of it that way, the possibilities are endless.

Think about a small coffee shop. You have a card, get a stamp every time you
make your regular order, and after 10 stamps you get a free coffee. \
\
Now imagine that same idea existed on the blockchain. Not only could you get a
stamp every time you get a coffee at this shop, but every time you buy coffee
made from those beans, anywhere in the world. Or instead of a free coffee, you
get a digital shirt that can be used in games across the metaverse — and send
you updates . Or that after making ten purchases, you get a voting token that
allows you to vote on decisions about the future of the coffee shop.

It’s very early still, but there may even be uses for this that are beyond what
anyone is thinking. That’s what’s so exciting — it’s removing a lot of the crud
that exists now and allowing merchants and customers to have a conversation.

## How do I get started?

If you’re a customer, all you have to do is download a wallet and find a store
or merchant that accepts Solana Pay!

If you’re a merchant who wants to start accepting Solana Pay, you’ll need the
help of a developer, but it’s very easy — and free — to set
up. [Learn more here.](https://solanapay.com/)
